### `useNavigate()` is a hook provided by the `react-router-dom` library that allows you to navigate to different routes in your React application. Here's an example of how you can use `useNavigate()` to navigate to a different route:

```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate()

  const handleClick = () => {
    navigate('/my-route')
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to My Route</button>
}
```

In this example, we're importing `useNavigate()` from `react-router-dom` and calling it to get a `navigate` function. We're then using the `navigate` function to navigate to the `/my-route` route when the button is clicked.

Note that `useNavigate()` can only be used within a component that is a descendant of a `<Router>` component. If you're using `BrowserRouter`, you can wrap your entire application in a `<BrowserRouter>` component to make `useNavigate()` available throughout your application.
