ThomPoppins: How do I implement dot-env in /frontend application

GitHub Copilot: To use environment variables in a frontend application, you can use the `dotenv` package. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the `dotenv` package with `npm install dotenv`.

2. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your environment variables to it. For example:

   ```
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5555
   REACT_APP_TEST_KVK_API=true
   REACT_APP_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL=/placeholders/profile-picture-placeholder-woman.jpeg
   REACT_APP_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL=/placeholders/profile-picture-placeholder-man.jpeg
   ```

   Note: In Create React App, you need to prefix your environment variables with `REACT_APP_` to be able to access them in your application.

3. In your `config.js` file, access the environment variables with `process.env`. For example:

   ```javascript
   export const BACKEND_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
   export const TEST_KVK_API = process.env.REACT_APP_TEST_KVK_API === 'true'
   export const FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL =
     process.env.REACT_APP_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
   export const MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL =
     process.env.REACT_APP_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
   ```

   Note: `process.env.REACT_APP_TEST_KVK_API` will be a string, so you need to compare it to `'true'` to get a boolean.

4. Now you can use your environment variables in your application. Remember to add your `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing it to your repository.

Remember to restart your development server after adding or changing environment variables.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'process' is not defined.

GitHub Copilot: The warning "'process' is not defined" is coming from ESLint. It's because `process` is a global object in Node.js, but ESLint doesn't know about it by default.

In a Create React App project, you can use `process.env` to access environment variables in your JavaScript code. Create React App includes the necessary webpack configuration to define the `process.env` object.

To fix the ESLint warning, you can add a global comment at the top of your file:

```javascript
/* global process */

export const BACKEND_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
export const TEST_KVK_API = process.env.REACT_APP_TEST_KVK_API === 'true'
export const FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL =
  process.env.REACT_APP_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
export const MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL =
  process.env.REACT_APP_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
```

This tells ESLint that `process` is a global variable and it's not undefined.

Alternatively, you can add `node: true` to the `env` section of your ESLint configuration file:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es6": true,
    "node": true
  }
}
```

This tells ESLint that your code will run in a Node.js environment, which defines the `process` global object.

ThomPoppins: Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined
<anonymous> http://localhost:5173/config.js:3
config.js:3:28
<anonymous> http://localhost:5173/config.js:3

GitHub Copilot: The error "Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined" is thrown because the `process` object is a global object provided by Node.js, and it's not available in the browser.

In a Create React App project, webpack replaces every instance of `process.env` with a string literal at build time, and this is why you can use `process.env` in your code even though it runs in the browser.

However, in a Vite project, you need to prefix your environment variables with `VITE_` to make them available in your code. Vite includes the necessary configuration to replace `import.meta.env` with the actual environment variables at build time.

Here's how you can access environment variables in a Vite project:

```javascript
export const BACKEND_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL
export const TEST_KVK_API = import.meta.env.VITE_TEST_KVK_API === 'true'
export const FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL = import.meta.env
  .VITE_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
export const MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL = import.meta.env
  .VITE_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
```

In your `.env` file, remember to prefix your environment variables with `VITE_`:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5555
VITE_TEST_KVK_API=true
VITE_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL=/placeholders/profile-picture-placeholder-woman.jpeg
VITE_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL=/placeholders/profile-picture-placeholder-man.jpeg
```

Remember to restart your development server after adding or changing environment variables.
