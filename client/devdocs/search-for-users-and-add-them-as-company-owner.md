**To allow the user to find other user accounts and add them as owners to the company in the `<EditCompany />` component, you can create a search bar that allows the user to search for other users by name or email. You can then display a list of search results and allow the user to select one or more users to add as owners to the company.**

Here are the steps you can follow to implement this feature:

1. Create a new component called `<UserSearch />` that will handle the user search functionality. This component should have a search bar and a list of search results.

2. In the `<UserSearch />` component, create a state variable to store the search query entered by the user. You can use the `useState()` hook to create this state variable.

3. Create a function that will handle the search query entered by the user. This function should make an API call to your backend to search for users based on the query entered by the user. You can use the `useEffect()` hook to call this function whenever the search query changes.

4. Display the search results in a list. Each search result should display the user's name and email, and should have a button that allows the user to add the user as an owner to the company.

5. In the `<EditCompany />` component, add a button that opens the `<UserSearch />` component when clicked. You can use the `useState()` hook to create a state variable that controls whether the `<UserSearch />` component is visible or not.

6. When the user selects a user to add as an owner to the company, update the `owners` state variable in the `<EditCompany />` component to include the selected user. You can use the `setOwners()` function to update the `owners` state variable.

7. When the user saves the changes to the company, make an API call to your backend to update the company with the new owners.

These are the basic steps you can follow to implement the user search functionality in the `<EditCompany />` component. You can customize the implementation based on your specific requirements and the technologies you are using.
