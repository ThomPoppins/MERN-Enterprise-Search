**To protect your application against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, you can follow these best practices:**

1. Sanitize user input: Always sanitize user input by removing any HTML tags or special characters that could be used to inject malicious code into your application. You can use a library like DOMPurify to sanitize user input.

2. Use Content Security Policy (CSP): CSP is a security feature that allows you to specify which sources of content are allowed to be loaded by your application. This can help prevent XSS attacks by blocking the execution of scripts from untrusted sources.

3. Use HTTP-only cookies: HTTP-only cookies can help prevent XSS attacks by preventing client-side scripts from accessing the cookie value. This can help protect sensitive information, such as authentication tokens.

4. Use a framework with built-in security features: Many modern web frameworks, such as React and Angular, have built-in security features that can help protect your application against XSS attacks. Make sure to use the latest version of your framework and keep it up-to-date.

5. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) header: A Content Security Policy (CSP) header is a HTTP response header that allows you to specify which sources of content are allowed to be loaded by your application. This can help prevent XSS attacks by blocking the execution of scripts from untrusted sources.

By following these best practices, you can help protect your application against XSS attacks and ensure the security of your users' data.
