## New Features

### Basic Search Functionality

- Users can now search for companies by name.
- Search results are listed in a grid with company images.
- Clicking on a company navigates the user to the company details page (Company Profile).
- If the current logged in user is a member (owner, employee, admin etc.) of the company, private details will be shown on the company profile page.

> **Search is ready to find pro's!**

> **CSS Grid used for structuring the Result components (the clickable company specific rectangle that redirects to their profile/details page)**

### Image Cropping

- Users can upload an image and crop it via drag-n-drop or file selection.
- Preview canvas shows the user how the crop will be in a round circled shape.
- The cropped image is displayed as the default profile picture.
- After cropping, users can download the cropped file.
- Cropped base64 binary images are converted into BLOB and uploaded to the Express.js server as a png file.
- Images are served as static files by the /backend Express.js server, acting as an images/files CDN for the frontend application.

            <p>Drag &apos;n&apos; drop image here, or click to select image</p>
          </div>

> **After dropping the image in the dropzone a ReactCrop component is rendered and a preview canvas:**

### Company Logo Cropping

- Implemented image crop functionality for company logos in the register and edit company pages.
- Company logos are displayed in a circle-shaped frame throughout the application.
- When cropping the logo image, companies can see how the logo will look within the circle-shaped border.

> **Company "logo's" can get cropped the same way as profile pictures with 1 / 1 aspect ratio:**

### Professions in Company Schema

- Added a new field to the company model for professions.
- Companies can add professions to their profiles during registration.
- Registereing companies professions will help the search result to become more relevant and dynamic.

### Storybook Integration

- Installed Storybook for component development.
- Added a few initial components to Storybook.

### Testing

- Jest and React-Testing-Library installed and functional.
- Ongoing work on writing tests for almost every component.

### Animations

- Added subtle animations for a more interactive user experience.
- Notification animations: when a user has a pending 'Invite,' the icon in the navigation bar right to their name turns yellow and starts wiggling, asking the user for attention.
- Dropdown has an "Invites" menu item on top with jumping letters to get the user's attention to the Invites page after clicking "Invites" in the dropdown menu.

**Subtle edit of Tailwind preinstalled animations making it a lot more joyful and grabs the user attention better:**

> /frontend/tailwind.config.js

```javascript file=/frontend/tailwind.config.js

      },
    },
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

### Co-Ownership Invites

- Notification icon wiggles when a user is invited for co-ownership of a company.
- "Invites" menu item is dynamically added to the dropdown menu.
- The menu item jumps to draw attention to pending co-ownership invites.
- Users can accept or decline co-ownership invites.
- After accepting or declining all pending invites (so no pending invites are left), the user gets redirected to the /companies page where all companies are listed that the user now (co-)owns.
- Safety measures implemented to prevent users from being invited twice, ensuring a unique co-owner status and no duplicate ownership registrations.

![Demo](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/GIF/Invites-animation.gif?raw=true)

## Pending issues

- Edit company professions feature is still pending.
- More components need to be added to Storybook.
- Ongoing work on writing tests for components.
- Editing company professions is still pending.
- After implementing professions in the Edit company page, the main search functionality will use professions as the second value to match on.

# Version v0.0.2 Release Notes

## Backend server CDN for static files

- The backend server now acts as a CDN for static files like images.
- The backend server serves static files from the /backend/public folder.
- This enables the frontend application to access images from the backend server without storing them in the frontend application.
- It also allows using the backend server as a CDN for other applications needing to access the images.

## File Upload

- Users can upload a profile picture.
- The profile picture is saved in the /backend/public/uploads/images folder.
- The image path is saved in the database.
- The backend server serves the image from the /backend/public folder.
- This enables the frontend application to access the image from the backend server, with the image path stored in the database.
