// TODO: [MERNSTACK-57] Create message schema and model. Messages will be linked to a company, based on an messageId in the message model. This model should contain the message text, timestamp, and more. Messages will be linked to a company, based on an messageId in the message model. This is a one-to-many relationship, between company and messages OR project and messages. It should not be hard to switch between the `company messenger inbox` and the `project messenger inbox`.
// TODO: [MERNSTACK-58] Create messenger functionality and use encryption for the privacy and security of the messages. Never store the encryption key in the database, only encrypt and decrypt the messages in the frontend. (Use a library for this)
// q: Which library should I use for encryption of personal chat messages?
// a: https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js
// TODO: [MERNSTACK-59] Make it possible for normal users to send messages to a company, project or employee. Make it possible for employees to respond to messages from users.
// TODO: [MERNSTACK-60] Make it possible for vendors to send messages to a company, project or employee. (Employees have to be authorized by the company (main) owner to connect with vendors). Make it possible for (authorized) employees, owners and companies to respond to messages from vendors.
// TODO: [MERNSTACK-61] Build a sharable functionality (a link to each functionality, agreement, project, product, revenue agreement, appointment or whatever) in all features where it is possible to communicate about between 2 related users. Make it possible to share a link from one to another if both users (companies, owners, (authorized) employees, project associates or whichever other user that is associated to each other in that specific "thing" they use, share (or possibly CAN share), or whatever way they (can) relate to each other for EVERY possible functionality and feature I can think of to be USEFUL and NOT too distracting from ANY more important things (functionalities or features).
