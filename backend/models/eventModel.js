// TODO: [MERNSTACK-86] Create a new schema and model for events. Events will be linked to a company, based on an eventId in the event model.
// TODO: [MERNSTACK-87] GOOD IDEA: Maybe it is possible to save the event data in a separate event model and schema, and link the event to the company, project or user. (one-to-one relationship) And think about how to link the event to `company`, `project`` and even `user` schemes and models.
