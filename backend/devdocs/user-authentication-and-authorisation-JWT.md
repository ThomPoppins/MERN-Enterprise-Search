### GitHub Copilot: When a user logs in to a React app, the best way to authorize them is to use an authentication token, such as a JSON Web Token (JWT). The JWT can be generated by the backend application (Express.js) and sent to the frontend (React) as a response to the login request. The frontend can then store the JWT in local storage or a cookie, and include it in subsequent requests to the backend to authenticate the user.

It is generally recommended to validate user authorization on the backend application (Express.js) rather than the frontend (React). This is because the backend is responsible for handling sensitive data and business logic, and is better equipped to enforce security measures such as authentication and authorization.

Here's an example of how you can use JWTs to authenticate users in a React and Express.js application:

1. When a user logs in to the React app, send a login request to the backend application (Express.js) with the user's credentials.

2. If the credentials are valid, generate a JWT on the backend using a library such as `jsonwebtoken`, and send the JWT as a response to the login request.

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

// ...

app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
  // Check user credentials
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  const user = users.find(
    (u) => u.username === username && u.password === password
  );
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid credentials" });
  }

  // Generate JWT
  const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET);

  // Send JWT as response
  res.json({ token });
});
```

In this example, the `jsonwebtoken` library is used to generate a JWT with a payload containing the `userId` of the authenticated user. The JWT is then sent as a response to the login request.

3. In the React app, store the JWT in local storage or a cookie.

```javascript
// ...

const handleLogin = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/login", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ username, password }),
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  });
  const { token } = await response.json();
  localStorage.setItem("token", token);
};
```

In this example, the JWT is stored in local storage using the `localStorage` API.

4. In subsequent requests to the backend, include the JWT in the `Authorization` header.

```javascript
// ...

const token = localStorage.getItem("token");

const response = await fetch("/protected-resource", {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
});
```

In this example, the JWT is included in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme.

5. On the backend, validate the JWT and extract the user ID from the payload.

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

// ...

app.get("/protected-resource", (req, res) => {
  // Get JWT from Authorization header
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(" ")[1];
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: "Missing token" });
  }

  // Verify JWT and extract user ID
  try {
    const { userId } = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    // Use user ID to authorize access to protected resource
    // ...
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid token" });
  }
});
```

In this example, the `jsonwebtoken` library is used to verify the JWT and extract the `userId` from the payload. The `userId` can then be used to authorize access to the protected resource.

By using JWTs to authenticate users and validating the JWTs on the backend, you can ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and business logic.
