ThomPoppins: In the browser the image is not loaded into the canvas while upImg has a value, why?

GitHub Copilot: It's hard to determine the exact issue without seeing the full code, but here are a few things you could check:

1. Ensure that the `upImg` state is being used as the source for an image element. The `onLoad` function should be triggered when this image is loaded.

2. Check if the `onLoad` function is being passed to the image element's `onLoad` prop.

3. Make sure that the image element with the `onLoad` prop is rendered whenever `upImg` changes.

Here's a general example of how this could look:

```javascript
<img src={upImg} onLoad={onLoad} alt='Crop' />
```

If you're still having issues, please provide more context or the full component code.

ThomPoppins: /explain Assignment to property of function parameter 'canvas'.

GitHub Copilot: The warning "Assignment to property of function parameter 'canvas'" is coming from a rule in ESLint, a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.

The rule that triggers this warning is `no-param-reassign`. This rule is aimed at preventing bugs that can be caused by reassigning parameters of a function.

In your code, you are reassigning the `width` and `height` properties of the `canvas` parameter:

```javascript
canvas.width = crop.width * pixelRatio * scaleX
canvas.height = crop.height * pixelRatio * scaleY
```

While this is not necessarily a problem, it can lead to confusing behavior because changing the property of the object also changes its value in the caller context. This is because objects in JavaScript are passed by reference.

If you want to keep your code as is and just silence the warning, you can disable the `no-param-reassign` rule for these lines:

```javascript
/* eslint-disable no-param-reassign */
canvas.width = crop.width * pixelRatio * scaleX
canvas.height = crop.height * pixelRatio * scaleY
/* eslint-enable no-param-reassign */
```

However, a better approach would be to avoid mutating the `canvas` directly. You could create a new canvas with the desired properties instead.

ThomPoppins: /explain Arrow function expected no return value.

GitHub Copilot: The warning "Arrow function expected no return value" is coming from a rule in ESLint, a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.

The rule that triggers this warning is `consistent-return`. This rule requires that all code paths in a function should explicitly return a value, or none of them should.

In your code, the arrow function in the `useEffect` hook returns a function in one code path (when `selectedFile` is truthy), but does not return anything in another code path (when `selectedFile` is falsy):

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!selectedFile) {
    setPreview('')
    return
  }

  const objectUrl = URL.createObjectURL(selectedFile)
  setPreview(objectUrl)

  return () => URL.revokeObjectURL(objectUrl)
}, [selectedFile])
```

To fix this warning, you can make sure that all code paths return a value. In this case, you could return a no-op function when `selectedFile` is falsy:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!selectedFile) {
    setPreview('')
    return () => {}
  }

  const objectUrl = URL.createObjectURL(selectedFile)
  setPreview(objectUrl)

  return () => URL.revokeObjectURL(objectUrl)
}, [selectedFile])
```

This way, the `useEffect` hook always returns a function, and the `consistent-return` rule is satisfied.

ThomPoppins: in the browser it logs completedCrop being an object with values, how is this possible while in the if statement above it tests for !completedCrop?

GitHub Copilot: In JavaScript, the `!` operator is used to check for the falsy value of a variable. In the code you provided, the `if` statement is checking if `completedCrop` is falsy, meaning it will evaluate to `true` if `completedCrop` is `null`, `undefined`, `false`, `0`, an empty string (`""`), or `NaN`.

If the `if` statement condition evaluates to `true`, it means that `completedCrop` is falsy, and the code inside the `if` block will be executed. On the other hand, if the condition evaluates to `false`, it means that `completedCrop` is truthy, and the code inside the `if` block will be skipped.

However, outside of the `if` statement, the `console.log(completedCrop)` statement is executed unconditionally. This means that regardless of whether `completedCrop` is truthy or falsy, the `console.log` statement will be executed and the value of `completedCrop` will be logged to the console.

So, in your case, if `completedCrop` is an object with values, it means that it is truthy, and the `if` statement condition evaluated to `false`, causing the code inside the `if` block to be skipped. But since the `console.log` statement is outside of the `if` statement, it will still execute and log the value of `completedCrop` to the console.In JavaScript, the `!` operator is used to check for the falsy value of a variable.

ThomPoppins: The img doesnt rerender when the `user` redux state is updated

GitHub Copilot: The issue might be related to how React handles updates and re-renders. React uses a diffing algorithm to compare the new and previous states. If the state changes but the result is the same (e.g., the `user.profilePictureURL` is updated but the URL remains the same), React might skip the re-render for performance optimization.

However, if the `user.profilePictureURL` is indeed changing and the image is not re-rendering, it might be due to the browser caching the image. Browsers often cache images to improve performance, and if the URL of the image doesn't change, the browser might not fetch the new image.

To force a re-render when the `user` state changes, you can append a unique query parameter to the image URL. This will make the URL unique each time and bypass the browser cache. Here's an example:

```javascript
<img
  alt='profile'
  className='mx-auto mt-2 h-64 w-64 rounded-full object-cover'
  src={
    user?.profilePictureURL
      ? `${user?.profilePictureURL}?${Date.now()}`
      : profilePicturePlaceholderURL
  }
/>
```

In this code, `Date.now()` is used to append a unique timestamp to the image URL each time the `user` state changes. This will force the browser to fetch the new image and cause the `img` component to re-render.

ThomPoppins: React doesnt rerender after redux state changes

GitHub Copilot: If React is not re-rendering after a Redux state change, it's likely because the component is not correctly connected to the Redux store, or the state change is not triggering a re-render.

Here's a general way to connect a component to the Redux store using the `useSelector` hook from `react-redux`:

```javascript
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'

// Inside your component
const user = useSelector((state) => state.user)
```

In this code, `state.user` should be replaced with the actual path to the `user` state in your Redux store.

If the component is correctly connected to the Redux store but is still not re-rendering, it might be because the state change is not causing a re-render. In React, a component re-renders when its state or props change. If the Redux state change is not causing a change in the component's state or props, the component will not re-render.

To force a re-render when the Redux state changes, you can use the `useEffect` hook:

```javascript
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'

// Inside your component
const user = useSelector((state) => state.user)

useEffect(() => {
  // This code will run whenever `user` changes
}, [user])
```

In this code, the `useEffect` hook will run whenever `user` changes, causing a re-render.

Why is the next state resetting the action and does the action not take effect? The profilePictureUrl in the 'user' state is reset back to the state previous to the action

GitHub Copilot: The issue you're experiencing might be due to how your reducer is handling the `SET_USER` action. If the `profilePictureURL` in the `user` state is being reset back to the previous state after the action, it suggests that the reducer might not be correctly updating the state.

Here's a general example of how your reducer might look:

```javascript
function userReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_USER':
      return {
        ...state,
        user: action.payload,
      }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

In this code, when the `SET_USER` action is dispatched, the reducer updates the `user` state with the payload of the action.

If your reducer looks similar to this and is still not updating the state correctly, it might be due to a problem with the action or the initial state.

Please ensure that the action payload contains the correct `profilePictureURL` and that the initial state is not overriding the updated state.

If you're still having issues, please provide more context or the full reducer code.

ThomPoppins: How do I make the images that are too long or too wide fit within the 300px x 300px size ReactCrop component?

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `imageStyle` prop of the `ReactCrop` component to set the CSS for the image. By setting `objectFit` to `contain`, the image will be scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the area you've specified.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<ReactCrop
  crop={crop}
  onChange={(c) => setCrop(c)}
  onComplete={(c) => setCompletedCrop(c)}
  onImageLoaded={onLoad}
  src={upImg}
  style={{
    width: '300px',
    height: '300px',
  }}
  imageStyle={{ objectFit: 'contain' }}
/>
```

In this code, `objectFit: 'contain'` ensures that the image will be resized to fit within the `ReactCrop` component while maintaining its aspect ratio.

ThomPoppins: the imageStyle prop is not working

GitHub Copilot: The `imageStyle` prop is not a recognized prop for the `ReactCrop` component. The `ReactCrop` component does not directly expose a way to style the image.

However, you can achieve the desired effect by controlling the aspect ratio of the crop box. The `aspect` prop of the `crop` object can be used to maintain the aspect ratio of the crop selection.

Here's an example:

```jsx
<ReactCrop
  src={upImg}
  crop={crop}
  onChange={(c) => setCrop(c)}
  onComplete={(c) => setCompletedCrop(c)}
  onImageLoaded={onLoad}
  style={{ width: '300px', height: '300px' }}
  crop={{ aspect: 1 }}
/>
```

In this code, `aspect: 1` ensures that the crop selection maintains a 1:1 aspect ratio, which will result in a square crop. Adjust the `aspect` value as needed to achieve the desired aspect ratio.

If you want to control the size of the image itself, you might need to resize the image before passing it to the `ReactCrop` component. This could be done using a library like `sharp` on the server side, or `browser-image-resizer` on the client side.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'onClose' is missing in props validation

GitHub Copilot: The warning "onClose is missing in props validation" is coming from the ESLint plugin `eslint-plugin-react`, specifically from the rule `react/prop-types`. This rule checks that all props used in a component are validated in the component's propTypes.

In your `ImageCrop` component, you're using the `onClose` prop, but you haven't defined it in your propTypes. To fix this warning, you should add `onClose` to your propTypes:

```jsx
ImageCrop.propTypes = {
  onClose: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  uploadImage: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
}
```

In this code, `PropTypes.func.isRequired` specifies that `onClose` should be a function and is required. If you don't provide it when using the `ImageCrop` component, React will log a warning in the console.

If `onClose` is not a required prop, you can use `PropTypes.func` without `isRequired`:

```jsx
ImageCrop.propTypes = {
  onClose: PropTypes.func,
  uploadImage: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
}
```

In this case, it's okay not to provide `onClose` when using the `ImageCrop` component.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'PropTypes' is not defined.

GitHub Copilot: The warning "PropTypes is not defined" means that the `PropTypes` object is being used without being imported first.

`PropTypes` is used for type checking in React. It's not part of the React core, but is included in a separate library called `prop-types`.

To use `PropTypes`, you need to import it at the top of your file:

```jsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
```

After adding this line, you should be able to use `PropTypes` in your component without getting a warning.

Your updated code should look like this:

```jsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

// ... rest of your code ...

ImageCrop.propTypes = {
  onClose: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
}

export default ImageCrop
```

ThomPoppins: Storybook error:

EditProfilePictureModal

Error: could not find react-redux context value; please ensure the component is wrapped in a <Provider>
at useSelector2 (/node_modules/.cache/sb-vite/deps/react-redux.js?v=19f9f010:537:9)
at ImageCrop (/src/components/users/EditProfilePictureModal.jsx?t=1700804538114:63:18)

GitHub Copilot: The error message is indicating that the `useSelector` hook from `react-redux` is being used in a component that is not wrapped in a `<Provider>` component. The `Provider` component makes the Redux store available to any nested components that call `useSelector`.

When you're using Storybook, each component is rendered in isolation, which means it won't have access to any parent components from your app, including the `Provider`.

To fix this issue, you need to wrap your component in a `Provider` with a mock store when you're writing stories for it. Here's an example:

```jsx
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import EditProfilePictureModal from './EditProfilePictureModal'

// Create a mock store
const mockStore = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    user: () => ({
      // Add the initial state for the 'user' slice here
    }),
  },
})

export const Default = () => (
  <Provider store={mockStore}>
    <EditProfilePictureModal />
  </Provider>
)
```

In this code, `configureStore` is used to create a mock store with the same structure as your actual store. You should replace the comment with the initial state for the 'user' slice.

This way, when Storybook renders the `EditProfilePictureModal` component, it will have access to the Redux store, and the `useSelector` hook will work as expected.

ThomPoppins: The input and button are not aligned horizontally in the browser, why not?

GitHub Copilot: The input and button may not be aligned horizontally due to the CSS styling applied to them. It's possible that the parent container or other surrounding elements have CSS properties such as `float`, `position`, or `display` that affect the layout. Additionally, the CSS classes applied to the input and button may have conflicting styles or positioning properties.

To align the input and button horizontally, you can try adjusting the CSS properties of the parent container or the elements themselves. You may need to modify the `float`, `position`, `display`, or `width` properties to achieve the desired layout.

ThomPoppins: Somehow the button and input field align when I increase the font size, any other solutions?

GitHub Copilot: If the alignment of the button and input field is affected by the font size, it's likely due to the line-height or vertical-align CSS properties. Here are a few solutions you could try:

1. **Use Flexbox:** Flexbox is a CSS layout module that makes it easy to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

```jsx
<div className='flex items-center'>
  <input className='...' />
  <button className='...'>Search</button>
</div>
```

In this code, `flex` sets the container to be a flex container, and `items-center` vertically aligns the items in the center.

2. **Adjust Line Height:** If increasing the font size fixes the alignment, adjusting the line height might also work. Try setting the line height to the same value as the height of the input field and button.

3. **Use Grid:** CSS Grid is another layout module that can be used to design complex layouts. It can be used to align items both horizontally and vertically.

```jsx
<div className='grid grid-cols-2 items-center'>
  <input className='...' />
  <button className='...'>Search</button>
</div>
```

In this code, `grid` sets the container to be a grid container, `grid-cols-2` creates a two-column grid, and `items-center` vertically aligns the items in the center.

Remember to replace the `'...'` with your actual class names or styles.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain This div should display on a new line beneath the div above

GitHub Copilot: To make the second `div` appear on a new line beneath the first `div`, you can use the `flex-direction` property with the value `column` on the parent container. This will arrange the child elements in a column, i.e., one below the other.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<div className='flex flex-col items-center'>
  <div className='display-block'></div>
  <div></div>
  <input />
</div>
```

In this code, `flex` sets the container to be a flex container, `flex-col` arranges the child elements in a column, and `items-center` horizontally aligns the items in the center.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain I want this div to jump to a new line on small screens

GitHub Copilot: To make the `div` jump to a new line on small screens, you can use the Tailwind CSS responsive design feature. This feature allows you to apply styles based on the size of the viewport.

In your case, you can use the `md:inline-block` and `block` classes. The `block` class will apply by default (on small screens), and the `md:inline-block` class will apply on medium screens and above.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<div className='md:inline-block block'>
  <button
    className={`ml-2 h-[50px] w-[160px] rounded-lg bg-gradient-to-r pl-4 ${
      findButtonPing
        ? 'animate-ping-once bg-gradient-to-l from-green-500 to-green-400'
        : 'animate-bounce-fast  from-violet-500 to-violet-600 hover:bg-gradient-to-l hover:from-green-500 hover:to-green-400'
    }`}
    data-testid='find-button'
    onClick={handleFind}
    type='button'
  >
    <div className='mx-auto'>
      <div className='float-left ml-7 py-2 text-xl'>Find </div>
      <img
        alt='Vind-Expert find button'
        className='rounded-xs float-right ml-2 mr-8 mt-[13px] h-5 w-5 object-cover'
        src={`${BACKEND_URL}/logo/vind-expert-transparent.png`}
      />
    </div>
  </button>
</div>
```

In this code, `md:inline-block` will make the `div` display inline on medium screens and above, and `block` will make the `div` display as a block (i.e., on a new line) on small screens.

ThomPoppins: that doesnt work

GitHub Copilot: If the `block md:inline-block` classes are not working as expected, it might be due to the structure of your HTML or the styles applied to other elements.

Another approach to make a `div` jump to a new line on small screens is to use CSS Flexbox with responsive design. You can make the parent container a flex container and change the direction of the flex items based on the screen size.

Here's an example:

```jsx
<div className='flex flex-col md:flex-row'>
  <div>Content 1</div>
  <div>Content 2</div>
</div>
```

In this code, `flex flex-col md:flex-row` applies the `flex` property to the container, making it a flex container. `flex-col` stacks the flex items vertically (in a column), and `md:flex-row` stacks the flex items horizontally (in a row) on medium screens and above.

Please replace `'Content 1'` and `'Content 2'` with your actual content. If you're still having issues, please provide more context or the full component code.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain I want this paragraph hidden on small screens

GitHub Copilot: To hide the paragraph on small screens, you can use the responsive design feature of Tailwind CSS. The `hidden` class can be used to hide an element, and the `md:block` class can be used to display the element as a block on medium screens and above.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<p className='md:block hidden'>
  Search any keywords to find the best relevant professionals in your area
  first.
</p>
```

In this code, `md:block` will make the paragraph display as a block on medium screens and above, and `hidden` will hide the paragraph on small screens.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain Write an explanation for the active selection as paragraphs of text.

          type='text'
          value={searchQuery}
        />
```

GitHub Copilot: The selected code is a JSX snippet for an input field in a React component. This input field is used to capture user input for a search query. Here's a breakdown of the key parts:

- `className`: This attribute is used to apply CSS styles to the input field. The classes used here are from Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The classes control various visual aspects of the input field such as height (`h-[50px]`), width (`w-full`), border (`border-2 border-purple-900`), background color (`bg-cyan-100`), padding (`px-4 py-2`), text color (`text-gray-800`), and responsive width on medium and large screens (`md:w-[570px] lg:w-[770px]`).

- `data-testid`: This attribute is used for testing. It provides a way to select the element in automated tests.

- `onBlur` and `onFocus`: These are event handlers that are triggered when the input field loses focus and gains focus, respectively. In both handlers, `event.target.select()` is used to select the text in the input field. In the `onBlur` handler, the placeholder text is set to a specific string. In the `onFocus` handler, the placeholder text is cleared.

- `onChange`: This event handler is triggered when the user types into the input field. It calls the `handleSearchQueryChange` function, which is not shown in the code snippet but presumably updates the state of the component with the new search query.

- `placeholder`: This attribute sets the placeholder text for the input field, which is displayed when the input field is empty and not focused.

- `type`: This attribute sets the type of the input field. In this case, it's set to 'text', which means the input field is a text field.

- `value`: This attribute sets the current value of the input field. It's set to `searchQuery`, which is presumably a state variable in the component that stores the current search query.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain I want the input to be 100% of the width of the parent div which on his turn has to be 100% width of the highest parent div always on a new line beneath the logo

GitHub Copilot: To make the input field take up 100% of the width of its parent `div`, you can use the `w-full` class from Tailwind CSS. This class sets the width of the element to 100% of its parent's width.

To make the parent `div` take up 100% of the width of its highest parent `div` and always appear on a new line beneath the logo, you can use the `w-full` and `block` classes. The `block` class makes the `div` display as a block-level element, which means it will start on a new line and take up the full width available.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```jsx
<div className='w-full block'>
  <div className='w-full'>
    <input
      className='h-[50px] w-full rounded-xl border-2 border-purple-900 bg-cyan-100 px-4 py-2 text-gray-800 focus:bg-white md:w-full lg:w-full md:inline-block md:mr-3 md:mb-0'
      data-testid='find-expert-search-query-input'
      onBlur={(event) => {
        // select this element
        event.target.select()

        // clear placeholder

In this code, I've added the `w-full` class to the parent `div` of the input field and replaced `md:w-[570px] lg:w-[770px]` with `md:w-full lg:w-full` in the input field's classes. This will make the input field take up 100% of the width of its parent `div` on all screen sizes.

GitHub Copilot: The error message `React2.useContext(...) is null` suggests that the context you're trying to access with `useContext` is not available. This usually happens when a context consumer (a component that uses `useContext`) is rendered outside of a corresponding context provider.

In your case, the error might be related to the `LinkWithRef` component from `react-router-dom`. This component uses the router context, which should be provided by a `BrowserRouter` or `Router` component.

If your `Navbar` component or any of its children use `Link` or any other routing-related components from `react-router-dom`, you need to make sure that they are rendered within a `BrowserRouter` or `Router` component.

Here's how you can modify your Storybook story to include a `BrowserRouter`:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

// ... rest of your code ...

export const Default = () => (
  <Provider store={mockStore}>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Navbar />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </Provider>
)
```

In this code, `BrowserRouter` is a context provider for the router context. By wrapping `Navbar` with `BrowserRouter`, you ensure that all routing-related components inside `Navbar` can access the router context.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain how should I combine the reducers with combineReducers?

GitHub Copilot: In Redux, `combineReducers` is a utility function to simplify the main reducer function in your application. It takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and creates a function that outputs the corresponding state object.

Here's how you can use `combineReducers`:

```javascript
import { combineReducers } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  userId: userIdReducer,
  user: userReducer,
})

export default rootReducer
```

In this code, `userIdReducer` and `userReducer` are the reducer functions for the `userId` and `user` slices of the state, respectively. You should replace them with your actual reducer functions.

After creating the root reducer, you can use it to create the store:

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import rootReducer from './reducers' // path to your rootReducer

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
})

export default store
```

In this code, `configureStore` is a function from Redux Toolkit that creates a Redux store. It takes a configuration object with a `reducer` property, which should be your root reducer.

ThomPoppins: How do I mock combineReducers in Navbar.stories?

GitHub Copilot: To mock `combineReducers` in your story, you need to create mock reducer functions for each slice of your state that the `Navbar` component interacts with. In your case, it seems like you have a `user` slice.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
import { combineReducers } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

let userReducer = (state = { firstName: 'Thom' }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    default:
      return state
  }
}

let rootReducer = combineReducers({
  user: userReducer,
})

const mockStore = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
})
```

In this code, `userReducer` is a mock reducer function for the `user` slice of the state. It always returns the same state, which has a `firstName` property set to `'Thom'`. `rootReducer` is the combined reducer, created using `combineReducers`.

Please replace `'Thom'` with the actual initial state for the `user` slice in your application. If your `Navbar` component interacts with other slices of the state, you should add corresponding mock reducer functions to `rootReducer`.

In your case, the `userReducer` and `userIdReducer` are passed to `combineReducers`. Make sure that these are valid reducer functions.

A reducer is a function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state. Here's an example of a simple reducer function:

      return { ...state, ...action.payload }
    default:

  }
}
```

In this code, `userReducer` is a reducer function for the `user` slice of the state. It takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state based on the action type.

If `userReducer` and `userIdReducer` are imported from another module, make sure that they are exported correctly from that module and imported correctly in your story.

If you're still having issues, please provide the code for `userReducer` and `userIdReducer`.

GitHub Copilot: The error message suggests that Storybook is having trouble loading the `Navbar.stories.jsx` module. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **File or directory does not exist:** Make sure that the `Navbar.stories.jsx` file exists in the `src/components/layout/` directory.

2. **Incorrect file extension:** Ensure that the file extension is correct. If your project is set up to use JavaScript, the file should have a `.js` extension. If it's set up to use JSX, the file should have a `.jsx` extension.

3. **Syntax error in the file:** There might be a syntax error in the `Navbar.stories.jsx` file that's preventing it from being loaded. Check the file for any syntax errors and fix them.

4. **Incorrect import statement:** If `Navbar.stories.jsx` is importing other modules, make sure that the import statements are correct. The paths should be correct, and the imported modules should be exported correctly from their respective files.

ThomPoppins: /explain ';' expected., Parsing error: Unexpected token :

GitHub Copilot: The error message is indicating that there's a syntax error in your `mockStore` object. The `getState` function should return an object, but the return statement is missing the `return` keyword and the parentheses around the object.

Here's how you can fix it:

```jsx
const mockStore = {
  getState: () => ({
    user: {
      id: '1',
      firstName: 'Test',
    },
  }),
}
```

In this code, `getState` is a function that returns an object. The object has a `user` property, which is another object with `id` and `firstName` properties. The parentheses around the object are necessary to distinguish the object literal from a block of code.

GitHub Copilot: The error message suggests that there's a component in your application that's causing an infinite loop of updates. This usually happens when a component's state or props are updated in a way that causes the component to re-render, and the update is triggered again during the re-render.

In your case, the issue might be related to the `Provider` component from `react-redux`. This component expects a Redux store as its `store` prop, but you're passing a mock store object. The `Provider` component might be trying to interact with the mock store as if it was a real Redux store, causing unexpected behavior.

Instead of creating a mock store object manually, you can use the `configureStore` function from Redux Toolkit to create a mock store. This function creates a Redux store that behaves like a real one, but allows you to specify the initial state.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const mockStore = configureStore({
  preloadedState: {
    userId: 'dkfjhk3h4ukh5k',
    user: {
      id: '1',
      firstName: 'Test',
    },
  },
})
```

In this code, `configureStore` is a function that creates a Redux store. It takes a configuration object with a `preloadedState` property, which should be the initial state of the store. The `preloadedState` is an object with `userId` and `user` properties, which are the slices of the state that your `Navbar` component interacts with.

Please replace `'dkfjhk3h4ukh5k'`, `'1'`, and `'Test'` with the actual initial state for the `userId` and `user` slices in your application. If your `Navbar` component interacts with other slices of the state, you should add them to `preloadedState`.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain How do I spread this column over all columns

GitHub Copilot: To make a table header (`<th>`) span across all columns in a table, you can use the `colSpan` attribute. The `colSpan` attribute specifies how many columns a cell should span.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<th className='text-2xl' colSpan='5'>
  About Me:
</th>
```

In this code, `colSpan="5"` means that the table header will span across 5 columns. Replace `5` with the actual number of columns in your table.

Remember that the `colSpan` attribute only works if there are enough columns in the table. If there are not enough columns, the cell will only span across the available columns.

ThomPoppins: what is a onboarding page?

GitHub Copilot: An onboarding page is a series of screens (also known as walkthroughs or tutorials) that guide users through the features of an application. They are typically displayed to new users when they first launch the app. The purpose of an onboarding page is to introduce the main features and benefits of the app, demonstrate how to use it, and help users understand how the app can serve their needs. This can help improve user engagement and retention.

ThomPoppins: /explain Missing an explicit type attribute for button

GitHub Copilot: The warning message you're seeing is suggesting that your button element is missing an explicit `type` attribute. In HTML, the `<button>` element has a `type` attribute which specifies the type of the button. The possible values are:

- `submit`: The button submits the form data to the server. This is the default if the attribute is not specified, or if the attribute is dynamically changed to an empty or invalid value.
- `reset`: The button resets all the controls to their initial values.
- `button`: The button has no default behavior. It can have client-side scripts associated with the element's events, which are triggered when the events occur.

In your case, if the `handleSaveUser` function is meant to submit a form, you should add `type="submit"` to the button:

```jsx
<button
  className='m-8 rounded-lg bg-gradient-to-r from-violet-600 to-purple-600 p-2 hover:bg-purple-700 hover:bg-gradient-to-l'
  data-testid='user-register-button'
  onClick={handleSaveUser}
  type='submit'
>
  Save
</button>
```

If the button is not meant to submit a form, you should add `type="button"` to prevent any default form submission behavior:

```jsx
<button
  className='m-8 rounded-lg bg-gradient-to-r from-violet-600 to-purple-600 p-2 hover:bg-purple-700 hover:bg-gradient-to-l'
  data-testid='user-register-button'
  onClick={handleSaveUser}
  type='button'
>
  Save
</button>
```

Adding an explicit `type` attribute to your buttons is a good practice because it makes your code more robust and prevents unexpected form submissions.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'useState' is not defined.

GitHub Copilot: The error message `'useState' is not defined` is indicating that the `useState` function from React is not imported in your file.

The `useState` function is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. To use it, you need to import it from the `react` package.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
```

In this code, `useState` is added to the list of named imports from `react`. Now you can use `useState` in your `CompanyModal` component.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'setLogoId' is missing in props validation

GitHub Copilot: The warning `'setLogoId' is missing in props validation` is coming from the ESLint plugin `eslint-plugin-react`, specifically the rule `react/prop-types`. This rule checks that all props used in a component are validated in the component's propTypes.

In your case, it's indicating that the prop `setLogoId` is not defined in the propTypes of the component where it's being used.

Here's how you can add it to propTypes:

```jsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

// ... rest of your component code ...

YourComponent.propTypes = {
  setLogoId: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
}
```

In this code, `YourComponent` should be replaced with the name of your component. `setLogoId` is defined as a required function prop. If the `setLogoId` prop is not provided or if it's not a function, a warning will be logged in the console.

Remember to import the `prop-types` package at the top of your file. If it's not already installed, you can install it with `npm install prop-types`.

ThomPoppins: /explain Expected to return a value at the end of async arrow function.

GitHub Copilot: The warning "Expected to return a value at the end of async arrow function" is coming from the ESLint rule `consistent-return`. This rule enforces that every code path in a function should return a value.

In your case, the async function passed to `router.post` returns a response in the `if` block, but doesn't return anything if the `if` condition is not met. This means that there's a code path that doesn't return a value.

To fix this, you should add a return statement at the end of the function. This return statement should handle the case where the `if` condition is not met. For example, you could return a 200 status code and a success message:

```javascript
router.post('/', async (request, response) => {
  // ... rest of your code ...

  if (!request.body.username || /* ... rest of your conditions ... */) {
    // ... your existing code ...
  }

  // Handle the case where the if condition is not met
  return response.status(200).send({
    message: 'User registration successful.',
  });
});
```

In this code, `response.status(200).send({ message: 'User registration successful.' })` is a return statement that sends a 200 status code and a success message. This return statement is executed if the `if` condition is not met.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain if the userId is userId of a object in the owners array in the companyDocument, then return status 200 true

GitHub Copilot: To check if the `userId` is in the `owners` array of the `companyDocument` and return a status of 200 if it is, you can use the `Array.prototype.includes()` method. This method checks if an array includes a certain value among its entries.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
router.get('/check-owner', async (req, res) => {
  const { userId } = req.body

  // Fetch the companyDocument from the database
  const companyDocument = await getCompanyDocument()

  if (companyDocument.owners.includes(userId)) {
    return res.status(200).json({ isOwner: true })
  } else {
    return res.status(200).json({ isOwner: false })
  }
})
```

In this code, `getCompanyDocument` is a function that fetches the `companyDocument` from the database. You should replace it with the actual function or method you're using to fetch the `companyDocument`.

The `Array.prototype.includes()` method is used to check if `userId` is in the `owners` array. If it is, the function returns a response with a status of 200 and a JSON object with `isOwner: true`. If it's not, the function returns a response with a status of 200 and a JSON object with `isOwner: false`.

ThomPoppins: /explain Visible, non-interactive elements with click handlers must have at least one keyboard listener.

GitHub Copilot: The warning "Visible, non-interactive elements with click handlers must have at least one keyboard listener" is coming from the ESLint plugin `jsx-a11y`, specifically the rule `jsx-a11y/click-events-have-key-events`. This rule enforces that elements with a `onClick` handler also have a handler for keyboard events such as `onKeyPress`, `onKeyDown`, or `onKeyUp`.

In your case, the warning is likely related to the `div` element with the `onClick` handler. This `div` element is non-interactive (it doesn't have a role that would make it focusable and interactive, like `button` or `a`), but it has a click handler. According to the `jsx-a11y/click-events-have-key-events` rule, it should also have a keyboard event handler.

Here's how you can add an `onKeyPress` handler to the `div`:

```jsx
<div
  className='relative m-4 flex h-auto w-[600px] max-w-full flex-col rounded-lg border-2 border-purple-900 bg-violet-950/40 px-4 py-2'
  data-testid='company-modal'
  key={result._id}
  onClick={(event) => event.stopPropagation()}
  onKeyPress={(event) => {
    if (event.key === 'Enter') {
      event.stopPropagation();
    }
  }}
  role='button'
  tabIndex={0}
>
```

In this code, `onKeyPress` is a function that stops the propagation of the event if the pressed key is 'Enter'. This makes the `div` behave like a button when the 'Enter' key is pressed.

Remember to add `role='button'` and `tabIndex={0}` to make the `div` focusable and interactive. Without these attributes, the `div` wouldn't be focusable, and the `onKeyPress` handler wouldn't work.

GitHub Copilot: The error "Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop." typically occurs when a state update function (like `setBackbuttonLink` in your case) is called inside the body of a function component or a hook, causing the component to re-render, and then the state update function is called again during the re-render, causing an infinite loop of re-renders.

In your code, the `setBackbuttonLink` function is called inside the body of the component, which might be causing the infinite loop of re-renders. To fix this, you should call `setBackbuttonLink` inside a `useEffect` hook. The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in function components, and it's the correct place to call state update functions that depend on props or state.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import { useEffect } from 'react'

// ... rest of your component code ...

useEffect(() => {
  const referrer = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('referrer')

  if (referrer) {
    setBackbuttonLink(`/find?query=${referrer}`)
  }
}, [])
```

In this code, `useEffect` is a function that takes a callback function and a dependency array as arguments. The callback function is executed after the component renders. The dependency array is empty, which means that the callback function is executed only once, after the initial render. This prevents the infinite loop of re-renders.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain ## Missing rate limiting

This route handler performs [a database access](1), but is not rate-limited.

[Show more details](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN_STACK_PROJ./security/code-scanning/3817)

GitHub Copilot: Rate limiting is a technique for preventing API abuse by ensuring a client can only make a certain number of requests in a given amount of time. It's important for protecting your server resources and maintaining the quality of service for all users.

In your code, the route handler for `GET /:id` doesn't have rate limiting. This means that a client could potentially make a large number of requests to this route in a short amount of time, which could overload your server or exhaust your database resources.

You can add rate limiting to this route with the `express-rate-limit` package. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit'

const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again after 15 minutes',
})

router.get('/:id', apiLimiter, async (request, response) => {
  // ... rest of your route handler code ...
})
```

In this code, `rateLimit` is a function that creates a rate limiter middleware. The `windowMs` option specifies the duration in milliseconds for which the maximum number of requests is counted. The `max` option specifies the maximum number of requests allowed in `windowMs`. The `message` option specifies the message to send back to the client when they hit the rate limit.

The `apiLimiter` middleware is then used in the `GET /:id` route. This applies the rate limit to this route.

Remember to install the `express-rate-limit` package with `npm install express-rate-limit` if it's not already installed.

ThomPoppins: What kind of options does rateLimit left?

GitHub Copilot: Sorry, but I can only assist with programming related questions.

ThomPoppins: What kind of options has rateLimit left from the express-rate-limit package left?

GitHub Copilot: Sorry, but I can only assist with programming related questions.

ThomPoppins: What kind of configurations has rateLimit left from the express-rate-limit package left?

GitHub Copilot: The `express-rate-limit` package provides several options for configuration:

1. `windowMs`: The duration in milliseconds for which the maximum number of requests is counted.

2. `max`: The maximum number of requests allowed in `windowMs`.

3. `message`: The message to send back to the client when they hit the rate limit.

4. `headers`: Whether to include rate limit headers in the response. If true, the middleware adds `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers.

5. `skip`: A function that takes the request and response objects as arguments and returns a boolean. If it returns true, the request is not counted towards the rate limit.

6. `keyGenerator`: A function that takes the request and response objects as arguments and returns a key that uniquely identifies the client. This key is used to count the requests.

7. `handler`: A function that's executed when the client hits the rate limit. By default, it sends a 429 status code and a "Too many requests, please try again later." message.

8. `onLimitReached`: A function that's executed the first time the client hits the rate limit within `windowMs`.

9. `draft_polli_ratelimit_headers`: Whether to include the draft RateLimit headers.

10. `statusCode`: The status code to send when the client hits the rate limit. The default is 429.

11. `skipFailedRequests`: Whether to count failed requests towards the rate limit. If true, failed requests are not counted.

12. `skipSuccessfulRequests`: Whether to count successful requests towards the rate limit. If true, successful requests are not counted.

Remember to check the [official documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit) for the most up-to-date information.

ThomPoppins: how do I whitelist my ip with skip: A function that takes the request and response objects as arguments and returns a boolean. If it returns true, the request is not counted towards the rate limit.

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `skip` option to whitelist your IP. The `skip` option is a function that takes the request and response objects as arguments and returns a boolean. If it returns `true`, the request is not counted towards the rate limit.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
  // 15 minutes:
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs:
  max: 300,
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again after 15 minutes',
  // The rest of the options:
  headers: true,
  skip: function (req, res) {
    // Replace 'YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE' with your IP address
    return req.ip === 'YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE'
  },
})
```

In this code, `skip` is a function that checks if `req.ip` (the IP address of the client) is equal to your IP address. If it is, the function returns `true`, and the request is not counted towards the rate limit. This effectively whitelists your IP address.

Remember to replace `'YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE'` with your actual IP address.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'setLogoUrl' is missing in props validation

GitHub Copilot: The warning "'setLogoUrl' is missing in props validation" is coming from the ESLint plugin `react/prop-types`. This rule enforces that all props used in a component are validated in the component's propTypes.

In your case, the `setLogoUrl` prop is used in the `EditCompanyLogoModal` component, but it's not validated in the component's propTypes. To fix this, you should add `setLogoUrl` to the propTypes of the `EditCompanyLogoModal` component.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

// ... rest of your component code ...

EditCompanyLogoModal.propTypes = {
  onClose: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  setLogoId: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  setLogoUrl: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
}
```

In this code, `PropTypes.func.isRequired` is a propType that specifies that the prop is a function and is required. This means that the `EditCompanyLogoModal` component must receive `onClose`, `setLogoId`, and `setLogoUrl` props, and they must be functions.

Remember to install the `prop-types` package with `npm install prop-types` if it's not already installed.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'disabled' is missing in props validation

GitHub Copilot: The warning "'disabled' is missing in props validation" is coming from the ESLint plugin `react/prop-types`. This rule enforces that all props used in a component are validated in the component's propTypes.

In your case, the `disabled` prop is used in the `MainSearch` component, but it's not validated in the component's propTypes. To fix this, you should add `disabled` to the propTypes of the `MainSearch` component.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

// ... rest of your component code ...

MainSearch.propTypes = {
  disabled: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,
  findButtonPing: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  handleFind: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  handleSearchQueryChange: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  searchQuery: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
}
```

In this code, `PropTypes.bool.isRequired` is a propType that specifies that the prop is a boolean and is required. This means that the `MainSearch` component must receive a `disabled` prop, and it must be a boolean.

Remember to install the `prop-types` package with `npm install prop-types` if it's not already installed.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'isDisabled' is missing in props validation

GitHub Copilot: The warning "'isDisabled' is missing in props validation" is coming from the ESLint plugin `react/prop-types`. This rule enforces that all props used in a component are validated in the component's propTypes.

In your case, the `isDisabled` prop is used in the `MainSearch` component, but it's not validated in the component's propTypes. To fix this, you should add `isDisabled` to the propTypes of the `MainSearch` component.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

// ... rest of your component code ...

MainSearch.propTypes = {
  isDisabled: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,
  findButtonPing: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  handleFind: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  handleSearchQueryChange: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  searchQuery: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
}
```

In this code, `PropTypes.bool.isRequired` is a propType that specifies that the prop is a boolean and is required. This means that the `MainSearch` component must receive an `isDisabled` prop, and it must be a boolean.

Remember to install the `prop-types` package with `npm install prop-types` if it's not already installed.

ThomPoppins: I want to make a grid of SearchResult components on wide screeens 3 next to each other and smaller 2, how?

GitHub Copilot: You can achieve this by using CSS Grid. You can set the `display` property of the parent container to `grid` and use the `grid-template-columns` property to specify the number of columns.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<div
  style={{
    display: 'grid',
    gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr))',
    gap: '1rem',
  }}
>
  {results.map((result) => (
    <SearchResult
      key={result._id}
      navigateToCompanyDetails={navigateToCompanyDetails}
      result={result}
    />
  ))}
</div>
```

In this code, `display: 'grid'` makes the div a grid container. `gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr))'` creates as many columns as can fit without any of them being less than 300px wide. If the container is wider than 900px, this will create 3 columns. If it's between 600px and 900px wide, it will create 2 columns. `gap: '1rem'` sets the gap between grid items to 1rem.

Remember to replace `results` with the actual array of results.

This solution assumes that you're using inline styles. If you're using a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components or emotion, or a CSS preprocessor like Sass, the syntax might be slightly different.

ThomPoppins: How do I implement dot-env in /frontend application

GitHub Copilot: To use environment variables in a frontend application, you can use the `dotenv` package. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the `dotenv` package with `npm install dotenv`.

2. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your environment variables to it. For example:

   ```
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5555
   REACT_APP_TEST_KVK_API=true
   REACT_APP_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL=/placeholders/profile-picture-placeholder-woman.jpeg
   REACT_APP_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL=/placeholders/profile-picture-placeholder-man.jpeg
   ```

   Note: In Create React App, you need to prefix your environment variables with `REACT_APP_` to be able to access them in your application.

3. In your `config.js` file, access the environment variables with `process.env`. For example:

   ```javascript
   export const BACKEND_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
   export const TEST_KVK_API = process.env.REACT_APP_TEST_KVK_API === 'true'
   export const FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL =
     process.env.REACT_APP_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
   export const MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL =
     process.env.REACT_APP_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
   ```

   Note: `process.env.REACT_APP_TEST_KVK_API` will be a string, so you need to compare it to `'true'` to get a boolean.

4. Now you can use your environment variables in your application. Remember to add your `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing it to your repository.

Remember to restart your development server after adding or changing environment variables.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'process' is not defined.

GitHub Copilot: The warning "'process' is not defined" is coming from ESLint. It's because `process` is a global object in Node.js, but ESLint doesn't know about it by default.

In a Create React App project, you can use `process.env` to access environment variables in your JavaScript code. Create React App includes the necessary webpack configuration to define the `process.env` object.

To fix the ESLint warning, you can add a global comment at the top of your file:

```javascript
/* global process */

export const BACKEND_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
export const TEST_KVK_API = process.env.REACT_APP_TEST_KVK_API === 'true'
export const FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL =
  process.env.REACT_APP_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
export const MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL =
  process.env.REACT_APP_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
```

This tells ESLint that `process` is a global variable and it's not undefined.

Alternatively, you can add `node: true` to the `env` section of your ESLint configuration file:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es6": true,
    "node": true
  }
}
```

This tells ESLint that your code will run in a Node.js environment, which defines the `process` global object.

ThomPoppins: Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined
<anonymous> http://localhost:5173/config.js:3
config.js:3:28
<anonymous> http://localhost:5173/config.js:3

GitHub Copilot: The error "Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined" is thrown because the `process` object is a global object provided by Node.js, and it's not available in the browser.

In a Create React App project, webpack replaces every instance of `process.env` with a string literal at build time, and this is why you can use `process.env` in your code even though it runs in the browser.

However, in a Vite project, you need to prefix your environment variables with `VITE_` to make them available in your code. Vite includes the necessary configuration to replace `import.meta.env` with the actual environment variables at build time.

Here's how you can access environment variables in a Vite project:

```javascript
export const BACKEND_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL
export const TEST_KVK_API = import.meta.env.VITE_TEST_KVK_API === 'true'
export const FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL = import.meta.env
  .VITE_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
export const MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL = import.meta.env
  .VITE_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
```

In your `.env` file, remember to prefix your environment variables with `VITE_`:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5555
VITE_TEST_KVK_API=true
VITE_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL=/placeholders/profile-picture-placeholder-woman.jpeg
VITE_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL=/placeholders/profile-picture-placeholder-man.jpeg
```

Remember to restart your development server after adding or changing environment variables.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain I want only the first 25 characters of the mailadres to display

GitHub Copilot: You can use the JavaScript `substring` method to display only the first 25 characters of the email address. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<h2 className='my-1'>{company.email.substring(0, 25)}</h2>
```

In this code, `substring(0, 25)` returns a new string that contains the characters from index 0 to index 24 (25 characters in total) of `company.email`. If `company.email` is less than 25 characters long, it returns the whole string.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain I want to declare that the array will only contain ObjectIds

GitHub Copilot: In Mongoose, you can specify that an array will only contain ObjectIds by using the `Schema.Types.ObjectId` type. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const { Schema } = mongoose

const companySchema = new Schema({
  // Other fields...
  relatedCompanies: [
    {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'Company', // Replace 'Company' with the name of your company model
    },
  ],
})

module.exports = mongoose.model('Company', companySchema)
```

In this code, `relatedCompanies` is an array of ObjectIds. Each ObjectId is expected to be the `_id` of a document from the 'Company' collection. The `ref` option is what tells Mongoose which model to use during population.

Remember to replace `'Company'` with the name of your company model.

GitHub Copilot: The warning "validateDOMNesting(...): `<div>` cannot appear as a descendant of `<p>`" is thrown because you have a `<div>` element inside a `<p>` element, which is not allowed in HTML.

In your `MainSearch` component, you have a `<p>` element that contains `{descriptionText}`. If `descriptionText` is a `<div>` element, this will cause the warning.

To fix this, you can replace the `<p>` element with a `<div>` element:

```jsx
<div className='relative float-left mb-3 ml-0 mt-6 hidden md:block'>
  <div className=''>{descriptionText}</div>
</div>
```

And:

```jsx
<div className='mb-3 ml-0 mt-2 block md:hidden'>
  <div className=''>{descriptionText}</div>
</div>
```

This will make your code valid HTML and remove the warning.

ThomPoppins: [plugin:vite:react-babel] C:\Users\31616\Documents\Apps\MERN-stack-project\frontend\src\pages\companies\RegisterCompany.jsx: Unexpected token, expected "," (272:4)
275 | name,

GitHub Copilot: The error message "Unexpected token, expected ','" is thrown because there's a syntax error in your code.

In your `professions` constant, you're using `map` to create a new array, but you're not returning anything from the callback function. This is causing the syntax error.

Here's how you can fix it:

```javascript
const professions = professionsInput.split(',').map((profession) => {
  return axios
    .get(`${BACKEND_URL}/professions?name=${profession.replace(/ /, '+')}`)
    .then((res) => {
      console.log('res', res)
      if (res.data.length === 0) {
        return axios
          .post(`${BACKEND_URL}/professions`, { name: profession })
          .then((res) => {
            console.log('res', res)
          })
      }
    })
})
```

In this code, `return` is added before `axios.get` to return the promise from the `map` callback function. This will create an array of promises.

If you want to wait for all the promises to resolve before continuing, you can use `Promise.all`:

```javascript
Promise.all(professions).then(() => {
  // Continue here...
})
```

In this code, `Promise.all(professions)` returns a new promise that resolves when all the promises in the `professions` array have resolved.

Error in GET /companies: CastError: Cast to ObjectId failed for value "profession" (type string) at path "\_id" for model "Company"

GitHub Copilot: The error "Cast to ObjectId failed for value 'profession' (type string) at path '\_id' for model 'Company'" is thrown because Mongoose is trying to convert the string 'profession' to an ObjectId, but it's not a valid ObjectId.

This error usually happens when you're trying to find a document by its `_id` and you're passing a string that's not a valid ObjectId.

In your `/companies` route, you're probably doing something like this:

```javascript
Company.findById(req.params.id)
```

And `req.params.id` is 'profession', which is not a valid ObjectId.

To fix this, you need to make sure that you're passing a valid ObjectId to `findById`. You can use the `mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid` function to check if a string is a valid ObjectId:

```javascript
if (mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(req.params.id)) {
  Company.findById(req.params.id)
  // ...
} else {
  // Handle invalid ObjectId...
}
```

In this code, `mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(req.params.id)` returns `true` if `req.params.id` is a valid ObjectId, and `false` otherwise.

GitHub Copilot: The error message "Cast to ObjectId failed for value 'profession' (type string) at path '\_id' for model 'Company'" is indicating that Mongoose is trying to convert the string 'profession' to an ObjectId, but it's not a valid ObjectId.

This error usually happens when you're trying to find a document by its `_id` and you're passing a string that's not a valid ObjectId.

In your `/companies` route, you're probably doing something like this:

```

In this code, `mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(req.params.id)` returns `true` if `req.params.id` is a valid ObjectId, and `false` otherwise.

If you're using the `profession` string as a placeholder or for testing, you should replace it with a valid ObjectId. If you're trying to find a company by its profession, you should use a different Mongoose method, like `find`:

```javascript
Company.find({ profession: req.params.profession })
```

In this code, `find({ profession: req.params.profession })` returns all the companies that have the given profession.

GitHub Copilot: The error message "Cast to ObjectId failed for value 'profession' (type string) at path '\_id' for model 'Company'" is indicating that Mongoose is trying to convert the string 'profession' to an ObjectId, but it's not a valid ObjectId.

This error usually happens when you're trying to find a document by its `_id` and you're passing a string that's not a valid ObjectId.

In your `/companies` route, you're probably doing something like this:

```javascript
Company.findById(req.params.id)
```

And `req.params.id` is 'profession', which is not a valid ObjectId.

To fix this, you need to make sure that you're passing a valid ObjectId to `findById`. You can use the `mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid` function to check if a string is a valid ObjectId:

```javascript
if (mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(req.params.id)) {
  Company.findById(req.params.id)
  // ...
} else {
  // Handle invalid ObjectId...
}
```

In this code, `mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(req.params.id)` returns `true` if `req.params.id` is a valid ObjectId, and `false` otherwise.

If you're using the `profession` string as a placeholder or for testing, you should replace it with a valid ObjectId. If you're trying to find a company by its profession, you should use a different Mongoose method, like `find`:

```javascript
Company.find({ profession: req.params.profession })
```

In this code, `find({ profession: req.params.profession })` returns all the companies that have the given profession.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain Is this the returnvalue from the latest then()?

GitHub Copilot: The `finally` block in a Promise chain will be executed no matter whether the Promise was fulfilled or rejected. However, it does not receive any arguments. In other words, the `returnValue` in your `finally` block is actually `undefined`.

If you want to access the result of the Promise, you should do so in a `then` block:

```javascript
.then((returnValue) => {
  console.log('Finished saving new profession, returnValue:', returnValue);
})
.finally(() => {
  console.log('This will run regardless of whether the Promise was fulfilled or rejected');
});
```

In this code, `returnValue` is the result of the Promise. The `finally` block is used to perform cleanup or other actions that should happen whether the Promise was fulfilled or rejected.

ThomPoppins: /explain A function with a name starting with an uppercase letter should only be used as a constructor.

GitHub Copilot: In JavaScript, the convention is to start constructor functions with an uppercase letter, while other functions should start with a lowercase letter. This is not a rule enforced by the language itself, but rather a widely accepted coding standard in the JavaScript community.

Constructor functions are used with the `new` keyword to create new objects. For example:

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name
  this.age = age
}

const john = new Person('John', 30)
```

In this code, `Person` is a constructor function because it's used with the `new` keyword to create new `Person` objects.

If you have a function that starts with an uppercase letter but isn't a constructor function, it might confuse other developers. They might think that the function is a constructor and try to use it with the `new` keyword, which could lead to unexpected results.

So, if your function isn't a constructor, it's a good idea to start its name with a lowercase letter to follow the convention and avoid confusion.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain Is this the correct way to work with Promises?

GitHub Copilot: The code you've provided has a few issues when it comes to working with Promises. Here are some corrections:

1. The Promise constructor takes two arguments: `resolve` and `reject`, in that order. You have them reversed.

2. You're creating a new Promise, but you're not returning it from the `map` callback function. This means that `professionsPromises` is an array of `undefined` instead of an array of Promises.

3. You're pushing the response data into `professionsArray` inside the Promise, but you're not using this array. If you want to collect the response data, you should do this in the `then` block after `Promise.all`.

Here's how you can fix these issues:

```javascript
let professionsArray = []

const professionsPromises = professionsInput
  .split(',')
  .map((professionName) => {
    // Check if profession already exists in database, if not, add it
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      // Return the Promise and correct the order of resolve and reject
      axios
        .get(
          `${BACKEND_URL}/companies/professionId/${professionName.replace(
            / /u,
            '+',
          )}`,
        )
        .then(async (res) => {
          if (res.data.length > 0) {
            console.log('res.data[0]._id: ', res.data[0]._id)
            return resolve(res.data)
          }

          if (res.data.length === 0) {
            await axios
              .post(`${BACKEND_URL}/companies/profession}`, {
                name: professionName,
              })
              .then((postProfessionResponse) => {
                console.log('postProfessionResponse: ', postProfessionResponse)
                return resolve(postProfessionResponse.data)
              })
              .catch((error) => {
                console.log(
                  'POST /companies/professions: save new profession error',
                  error,
                )
                return reject(error)
              })
          }
          return resolve(res.data)
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          reject(error)
        })
        .finally(() => {
          console.log('Finished getting profession')
        })
    })
  })

let professionsResponseDocuments = []

await Promise.all(professionsPromises)
  .then((proffesionsResponses) => {
    console.log('proffesionsResponses: ', proffesionsResponses)

    professionsResponseDocuments = proffesionsResponses

    return proffesionsResponses
  })

  .catch((error) => {
    console.log('error: ', error)
  })

console.log('professionsResponseDocuments: ', professionsResponseDocuments)
```

In this code, `return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { ... })` is added to return the Promise from the `map` callback function, and `resolve` and `reject` are in the correct order. The response data is collected in the `then` block after `Promise.all`.

ThomPoppins: You're creating a new Promise, but you're not returning it from the map callback function. This means that professionsPromises is an array of undefined instead of an array of Promises. Explain!

GitHub Copilot: In JavaScript, the `map` function is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array. The function that you pass to `map` is expected to return the new element that will be added to the new array.

In your code, you're passing a function to `map` that creates a new Promise, but you're not returning this Promise from the function. This means that `map` is creating a new array where each element is `undefined` (because your function doesn't return anything), instead of an array of Promises.

Here's how you can fix this:

```javascript
const professionsPromises = professionsInput
  .split(',')
  .map((professionName) => {
    // Check if profession already exists in database, if not, add it
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      // Add return here
      // ...
    })
  })
```

In this code, `return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { ... })` is added to return the Promise from the `map` callback function. This will create an array of Promises, which you can then pass to `Promise.all` to wait for all the Promises to resolve.

code: 'ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT'

GitHub Copilot: The error message "Converting circular structure to JSON" means that there's a property in the object you're trying to stringify that references the object itself, either directly or indirectly. JSON.stringify cannot handle such situations and throws an error.

In your case, it seems like you're trying to send the `newProfession` object as a response. This object might contain circular references, which is causing the error.

One way to fix this issue is to create a new object that only contains the properties you want to send in the response:

```javascript
.then((document) => {
  console.log('new Profession document: ', document)
  const responseData = {
    name: document.name,
    _id: document._id,
    createdAt: document.createdAt,
    updatedAt: document.updatedAt
  };
  return response.status(201).send(responseData)
})
```

In this code, `responseData` is a new object that only contains the properties `name`, `_id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` from the `document` object. This object should not contain any circular references, so you can send it as a response without getting an error.

Also, you're sending the response twice which is causing the 'ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT' error. Once in the `then` block and once after the `then` block. You should only send the response once. The corrected code above removes the second `response.send`.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain

GitHub Copilot: The line of code you've provided is from a JavaScript file, likely part of a Node.js project using Express.js or a similar framework. This line is part of a route handler function that processes HTTP requests.

`request.body.name.strip();` is attempting to access the `name` property of the `body` object of the `request`. The `request.body` typically contains data sent by the client in the body of the HTTP request. In this case, it's expected to be an object that has a `name` property.

The `.strip()` method is intended to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the `name` string. However, it's important to note that in JavaScript, the correct method to remove leading and trailing whitespace from a string is `.trim()`, not `.strip()`.

So, if you're trying to remove whitespace from the `name` string, you should use `request.body.name.trim();` instead. If you're getting an error on this line, it's likely because `.strip()` is not a valid method in JavaScript.

GitHub Copilot: The error message "TypeError: minimatch is not a function" suggests that the `minimatch` function is being called somewhere in your code, but it's not defined or not imported correctly.

`minimatch` is a library used to match strings against patterns, similar to how shell commands work. It's often used in Node.js projects for tasks like file matching.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. Make sure the `minimatch` package is installed in your project. You can install it with `npm install minimatch` or `pnpm add minimatch` if you're using pnpm.

2. Check the file where the error is being thrown (`run.js`), and make sure `minimatch` is being imported correctly at the top of the file. The correct import statement would look something like this:

```javascript
const minimatch = require('minimatch')
```

3. If `minimatch` is a dependency of another package (in this case, it seems to be a dependency of the `run` package), there might be an issue with that package itself. Try reinstalling the package with `npm reinstall run` or `pnpm up run`.

If none of these suggestions work, there might be a deeper issue with your project configuration or the `run` package itself. You might need to reach out to the maintainers of the `run` package for help.

ThomPoppins: how do I use changeset from the root of my workdirectory frontend and backend application included

GitHub Copilot: To use the `changeset` command from the root of your work directory, you need to add a script in your `package.json` file that runs `changeset` in both the frontend and backend directories.

Here's how you can do it:

1. First, make sure that both your frontend and backend directories have their own `package.json` files and that `changeset` is installed in both directories.

2. Then, in the `package.json` file in the root directory, add a script that runs `changeset` in both directories. Here's an example:

```json
"scripts": {
  "changeset": "cd frontend && npm run changeset && cd ../backend && npm run changeset"
}
```

In this script, `cd frontend && npm run changeset` changes the current directory to the frontend directory and runs the `changeset` command. `cd ../backend && npm run changeset` does the same for the backend directory.

3. Now, you can run the `changeset` command in both directories by running `npm run changeset` in the root directory.

Please note that this is a simple example and might not cover all use cases. Depending on your project structure and the exact requirements of your workflow, you might need to adjust this script.

GitHub Copilot: The error message `ERR_PNPM_DLX_NO_BIN  No binaries found in changeset` suggests that the `changeset` command is not found. This could be because the `@changesets/cli` package, which provides the `changeset` command, is not installed in your project.

To fix this issue, you need to install the `@changesets/cli` package. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm add --dev @changesets/cli
```

This command installs the `@changesets/cli` package as a development dependency in your project. After running this command, you should be able to use the `changeset` command.

If you're using a monorepo structure (which it seems like you might be, given that you have separate frontend and backend directories), you should install `@changesets/cli` in the root of your project, not in the individual frontend or backend directories. In a monorepo, `changesets` should be run from the root of the project, not from the individual package directories.

GitHub Copilot: The error message `ERR_PNPM_DLX_NO_BIN  No binaries found in changesets` suggests that the `changesets` command is not found. This could be because the `@changesets/cli` package, which provides the `changesets` command, is not installed in your project or not being called correctly.

In your `package.json` file, you have installed `@changesets/cli` which is the correct package. However, in your scripts and the command you're trying to run, you're using `changesets` instead of `changeset`.

Here's how you can fix this:

1. Update your scripts in `package.json` to use `changeset` instead of `changesets`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "changesets:all": "cd frontend && npm run changeset && cd ../backend && npm run changeset",
  "changesets:root": "changeset version"
}
```

2. Run the `changeset` command with `pnpx` like this:

```bash
pnpx changeset version
```

This should run the `version` command from the `@changesets/cli` package. If you want to specify a version number, you can do so in the `changeset` command itself, not in the `pnpx` command. For example:

```bash
pnpx changeset version --nextVersion v0.0.3
```

Please note that the `version` command in `changeset` does not accept a version number as an argument. The `--nextVersion` flag is just an example and might not be a valid flag for the `version` command. You should check the `changeset` documentation to see how to specify a version number.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain How should this changeset config file be structured and configured?

GitHub Copilot: The `@changesets/config` package is used to configure how Changesets works in your project. The configuration is stored in a `.changeset/config.json` file in the root of your project.

Here's an example of how the `config.json` file might be structured:

```json
{
  "changelog": "@changesets/cli/changelog",
  "commit": false,
  "linked": [],
  "access": "restricted",
  "baseBranch": "main",
  "updateInternalDependencies": "patch",
  "ignore": []
}
```

Here's what each property does:

- `changelog`: Specifies the package to use for generating changelogs. The default is `"@changesets/cli/changelog"`.

- `commit`: If set to `true`, Changesets will commit the changes it makes (like updating changelogs and version numbers). The default is `false`.

- `linked`: An array of arrays of package names. If two packages are in the same array, they will always be versioned together.

- `access`: Can be either `"restricted"` or `"public"`. This is used when publishing packages to the npm registry.

- `baseBranch`: The base branch that Changesets should use. The default is `"main"`.

- `updateInternalDependencies`: Can be `"patch"`, `"minor"`, or `"major"`. This specifies how Changesets should update the versions of internal dependencies.

- `ignore`: An array of package names that Changesets should ignore.

Please note that this is just an example and your actual configuration might be different depending on your project's needs. You should check the [Changesets documentation](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/main/docs/config-file-options.md) for more information on how to configure Changesets.

ThomPoppins: In the browser the image is not loaded into the canvas while upImg has a value, why?

GitHub Copilot: It's hard to determine the exact issue without seeing the full code, but here are a few things you could check:

1. Ensure that the `upImg` state is being used as the source for an image element. The `onLoad` function should be triggered when this image is loaded.

2. Check if the `onLoad` function is being passed to the image element's `onLoad` prop.

3. Make sure that the image element with the `onLoad` prop is rendered whenever `upImg` changes.

Here's a general example of how this could look:

```javascript

ThomPoppins: /explain Assignment to property of function parameter 'canvas'.

GitHub Copilot: The warning "Assignment to property of function parameter 'canvas'" is coming from a rule in ESLint, a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.

The rule that triggers this warning is `no-param-reassign`. This rule is aimed at preventing bugs that can be caused by reassigning parameters of a function.

In your code, you are reassigning the `width` and `height` properties of the `canvas` parameter:

```javascript
canvas.width = crop.width * pixelRatio * scaleX
canvas.height = crop.height * pixelRatio * scaleY
```

While this is not necessarily a problem, it can lead to confusing behavior because changing the property of the object also changes its value in the caller context. This is because objects in JavaScript are passed by reference.

If you want to keep your code as is and just silence the warning, you can disable the `no-param-reassign` rule for these lines:

```javascript
/* eslint-disable no-param-reassign */
canvas.width = crop.width * pixelRatio * scaleX
canvas.height = crop.height * pixelRatio * scaleY
/* eslint-enable no-param-reassign */
```

However, a better approach would be to avoid mutating the `canvas` directly. You could create a new canvas with the desired properties instead.

ThomPoppins: /explain Arrow function expected no return value.

GitHub Copilot: The warning "Arrow function expected no return value" is coming from a rule in ESLint, a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.

The rule that triggers this warning is `consistent-return`. This rule requires that all code paths in a function should explicitly return a value, or none of them should.

In your code, the arrow function in the `useEffect` hook returns a function in one code path (when `selectedFile` is truthy), but does not return anything in another code path (when `selectedFile` is falsy):

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!selectedFile) {
    setPreview('')
    return
  }

  const objectUrl = URL.createObjectURL(selectedFile)
  setPreview(objectUrl)

  return () => URL.revokeObjectURL(objectUrl)
}, [selectedFile])
```

To fix this warning, you can make sure that all code paths return a value. In this case, you could return a no-op function when `selectedFile` is falsy:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!selectedFile) {
    setPreview('')
    return () => {}
  }

  const objectUrl = URL.createObjectURL(selectedFile)
  setPreview(objectUrl)

  return () => URL.revokeObjectURL(objectUrl)
}, [selectedFile])
```

This way, the `useEffect` hook always returns a function, and the `consistent-return` rule is satisfied.

ThomPoppins: in the browser it logs completedCrop being an object with values, how is this possible while in the if statement above it tests for !completedCrop?

GitHub Copilot: In JavaScript, the `!` operator is used to check for the falsy value of a variable. In the code you provided, the `if` statement is checking if `completedCrop` is falsy, meaning it will evaluate to `true` if `completedCrop` is `null`, `undefined`, `false`, `0`, an empty string (`""`), or `NaN`.

If the `if` statement condition evaluates to `true`, it means that `completedCrop` is falsy, and the code inside the `if` block will be executed. On the other hand, if the condition evaluates to `false`, it means that `completedCrop` is truthy, and the code inside the `if` block will be skipped.

However, outside of the `if` statement, the `console.log(completedCrop)` statement is executed unconditionally. This means that regardless of whether `completedCrop` is truthy or falsy, the `console.log` statement will be executed and the value of `completedCrop` will be logged to the console.

So, in your case, if `completedCrop` is an object with values, it means that it is truthy, and the `if` statement condition evaluated to `false`, causing the code inside the `if` block to be skipped. But since the `console.log` statement is outside of the `if` statement, it will still execute and log the value of `completedCrop` to the console.In JavaScript, the `!` operator is used to check for the falsy value of a variable.

ThomPoppins: The img doesnt rerender when the `user` redux state is updated

GitHub Copilot: The issue might be related to how React handles updates and re-renders. React uses a diffing algorithm to compare the new and previous states. If the state changes but the result is the same (e.g., the `user.profilePictureURL` is updated but the URL remains the same), React might skip the re-render for performance optimization.

However, if the `user.profilePictureURL` is indeed changing and the image is not re-rendering, it might be due to the browser caching the image. Browsers often cache images to improve performance, and if the URL of the image doesn't change, the browser might not fetch the new image.

To force a re-render when the `user` state changes, you can append a unique query parameter to the image URL. This will make the URL unique each time and bypass the browser cache. Here's an example:

```javascript
<img
  alt='profile'
  className='mx-auto mt-2 h-64 w-64 rounded-full object-cover'
  src={
    user?.profilePictureURL
      ? `${user?.profilePictureURL}?${Date.now()}`
      : profilePicturePlaceholderURL
  }
/>
```

In this code, `Date.now()` is used to append a unique timestamp to the image URL each time the `user` state changes. This will force the browser to fetch the new image and cause the `img` component to re-render.

ThomPoppins: React doesnt rerender after redux state changes

GitHub Copilot: If React is not re-rendering after a Redux state change, it's likely because the component is not correctly connected to the Redux store, or the state change is not triggering a re-render.

Here's a general way to connect a component to the Redux store using the `useSelector` hook from `react-redux`:

```javascript
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'

// Inside your component
const user = useSelector((state) => state.user)
```

In this code, `state.user` should be replaced with the actual path to the `user` state in your Redux store.

If the component is correctly connected to the Redux store but is still not re-rendering, it might be because the state change is not causing a re-render. In React, a component re-renders when its state or props change. If the Redux state change is not causing a change in the component's state or props, the component will not re-render.

To force a re-render when the Redux state changes, you can use the `useEffect` hook:

```javascript
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'

// Inside your component
const user = useSelector((state) => state.user)

useEffect(() => {
  // This code will run whenever `user` changes
}, [user])
```

In this code, the `useEffect` hook will run whenever `user` changes, causing a re-render.

Why is the next state resetting the action and does the action not take effect? The profilePictureUrl in the 'user' state is reset back to the state previous to the action

GitHub Copilot: The issue you're experiencing might be due to how your reducer is handling the `SET_USER` action. If the `profilePictureURL` in the `user` state is being reset back to the previous state after the action, it suggests that the reducer might not be correctly updating the state.

Here's a general example of how your reducer might look:

```javascript
function userReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_USER':
      return {
        ...state,
        user: action.payload,
      }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

In this code, when the `SET_USER` action is dispatched, the reducer updates the `user` state with the payload of the action.

If your reducer looks similar to this and is still not updating the state correctly, it might be due to a problem with the action or the initial state.

Please ensure that the action payload contains the correct `profilePictureURL` and that the initial state is not overriding the updated state.

If you're still having issues, please provide more context or the full reducer code.

ThomPoppins: How do I make the images that are too long or too wide fit within the 300px x 300px size ReactCrop component?

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `imageStyle` prop of the `ReactCrop` component to set the CSS for the image. By setting `objectFit` to `contain`, the image will be scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the area you've specified.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<ReactCrop
  crop={crop}
  onChange={(c) => setCrop(c)}
  onComplete={(c) => setCompletedCrop(c)}
  onImageLoaded={onLoad}
  src={upImg}
  style={{
    width: '300px',
    height: '300px',
  }}
  imageStyle={{ objectFit: 'contain' }}
/>
```

In this code, `objectFit: 'contain'` ensures that the image will be resized to fit within the `ReactCrop` component while maintaining its aspect ratio.

ThomPoppins: the imageStyle prop is not working

GitHub Copilot: The `imageStyle` prop is not a recognized prop for the `ReactCrop` component. The `ReactCrop` component does not directly expose a way to style the image.

However, you can achieve the desired effect by controlling the aspect ratio of the crop box. The `aspect` prop of the `crop` object can be used to maintain the aspect ratio of the crop selection.

Here's an example:

```jsx
<ReactCrop
  src={upImg}
  crop={crop}
  onChange={(c) => setCrop(c)}
  onComplete={(c) => setCompletedCrop(c)}
  onImageLoaded={onLoad}
  style={{ width: '300px', height: '300px' }}
  crop={{ aspect: 1 }}
/>
```

In this code, `aspect: 1` ensures that the crop selection maintains a 1:1 aspect ratio, which will result in a square crop. Adjust the `aspect` value as needed to achieve the desired aspect ratio.

If you want to control the size of the image itself, you might need to resize the image before passing it to the `ReactCrop` component. This could be done using a library like `sharp` on the server side, or `browser-image-resizer` on the client side.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'onClose' is missing in props validation

GitHub Copilot: The warning "onClose is missing in props validation" is coming from the ESLint plugin `eslint-plugin-react`, specifically from the rule `react/prop-types`. This rule checks that all props used in a component are validated in the component's propTypes.

In your `ImageCrop` component, you're using the `onClose` prop, but you haven't defined it in your propTypes. To fix this warning, you should add `onClose` to your propTypes:

```jsx
ImageCrop.propTypes = {
  onClose: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  uploadImage: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
}
```

In this code, `PropTypes.func.isRequired` specifies that `onClose` should be a function and is required. If you don't provide it when using the `ImageCrop` component, React will log a warning in the console.

If `onClose` is not a required prop, you can use `PropTypes.func` without `isRequired`:

```jsx
ImageCrop.propTypes = {
  onClose: PropTypes.func,
  uploadImage: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
}
```

In this case, it's okay not to provide `onClose` when using the `ImageCrop` component.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'PropTypes' is not defined.

GitHub Copilot: The warning "PropTypes is not defined" means that the `PropTypes` object is being used without being imported first.

`PropTypes` is used for type checking in React. It's not part of the React core, but is included in a separate library called `prop-types`.

To use `PropTypes`, you need to import it at the top of your file:

```jsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
```

After adding this line, you should be able to use `PropTypes` in your component without getting a warning.

Your updated code should look like this:

```jsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

// ... rest of your code ...

ImageCrop.propTypes = {
  onClose: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
}

export default ImageCrop
```

ThomPoppins: Storybook error:

EditProfilePictureModal

Error: could not find react-redux context value; please ensure the component is wrapped in a <Provider>
at useSelector2 (/node_modules/.cache/sb-vite/deps/react-redux.js?v=19f9f010:537:9)
at ImageCrop (/src/components/users/EditProfilePictureModal.jsx?t=1700804538114:63:18)

GitHub Copilot: The error message is indicating that the `useSelector` hook from `react-redux` is being used in a component that is not wrapped in a `<Provider>` component. The `Provider` component makes the Redux store available to any nested components that call `useSelector`.

When you're using Storybook, each component is rendered in isolation, which means it won't have access to any parent components from your app, including the `Provider`.

To fix this issue, you need to wrap your component in a `Provider` with a mock store when you're writing stories for it. Here's an example:

```jsx
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import EditProfilePictureModal from './EditProfilePictureModal'

// Create a mock store
const mockStore = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    user: () => ({
      // Add the initial state for the 'user' slice here
    }),
  },
})

export const Default = () => (
  <Provider store={mockStore}>
    <EditProfilePictureModal />
  </Provider>
)
```

In this code, `configureStore` is used to create a mock store with the same structure as your actual store. You should replace the comment with the initial state for the 'user' slice.

This way, when Storybook renders the `EditProfilePictureModal` component, it will have access to the Redux store, and the `useSelector` hook will work as expected.

ThomPoppins: The input and button are not aligned horizontally in the browser, why not?

GitHub Copilot: The input and button may not be aligned horizontally due to the CSS styling applied to them. It's possible that the parent container or other surrounding elements have CSS properties such as `float`, `position`, or `display` that affect the layout. Additionally, the CSS classes applied to the input and button may have conflicting styles or positioning properties.

To align the input and button horizontally, you can try adjusting the CSS properties of the parent container or the elements themselves. You may need to modify the `float`, `position`, `display`, or `width` properties to achieve the desired layout.

ThomPoppins: Somehow the button and input field align when I increase the font size, any other solutions?

GitHub Copilot: If the alignment of the button and input field is affected by the font size, it's likely due to the line-height or vertical-align CSS properties. Here are a few solutions you could try:

1. **Use Flexbox:** Flexbox is a CSS layout module that makes it easy to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

```jsx
<div className='flex items-center'>
  <input className='...' />
  <button className='...'>Search</button>
</div>
```

In this code, `flex` sets the container to be a flex container, and `items-center` vertically aligns the items in the center.

2. **Adjust Line Height:** If increasing the font size fixes the alignment, adjusting the line height might also work. Try setting the line height to the same value as the height of the input field and button.

3. **Use Grid:** CSS Grid is another layout module that can be used to design complex layouts. It can be used to align items both horizontally and vertically.

```jsx
<div className='grid grid-cols-2 items-center'>
  <input className='...' />
  <button className='...'>Search</button>
</div>
```

In this code, `grid` sets the container to be a grid container, `grid-cols-2` creates a two-column grid, and `items-center` vertically aligns the items in the center.

Remember to replace the `'...'` with your actual class names or styles.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain This div should display on a new line beneath the div above

GitHub Copilot: To make the second `div` appear on a new line beneath the first `div`, you can use the `flex-direction` property with the value `column` on the parent container. This will arrange the child elements in a column, i.e., one below the other.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<div className='flex flex-col items-center'>
  <div className='display-block'></div>
  <div></div>
  <input />
</div>
```

In this code, `flex` sets the container to be a flex container, `flex-col` arranges the child elements in a column, and `items-center` horizontally aligns the items in the center.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain I want this div to jump to a new line on small screens

GitHub Copilot: To make the `div` jump to a new line on small screens, you can use the Tailwind CSS responsive design feature. This feature allows you to apply styles based on the size of the viewport.

In your case, you can use the `md:inline-block` and `block` classes. The `block` class will apply by default (on small screens), and the `md:inline-block` class will apply on medium screens and above.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<div className='md:inline-block block'>
  <button
    className={`ml-2 h-[50px] w-[160px] rounded-lg bg-gradient-to-r pl-4 ${
      findButtonPing
        ? 'animate-ping-once bg-gradient-to-l from-green-500 to-green-400'
        : 'animate-bounce-fast  from-violet-500 to-violet-600 hover:bg-gradient-to-l hover:from-green-500 hover:to-green-400'
    }`}
    data-testid='find-button'
    onClick={handleFind}
    type='button'
  >
    <div className='mx-auto'>
      <div className='float-left ml-7 py-2 text-xl'>Find </div>
      <img
        alt='Vind-Expert find button'
        className='rounded-xs float-right ml-2 mr-8 mt-[13px] h-5 w-5 object-cover'
        src={`${BACKEND_URL}/logo/vind-expert-transparent.png`}
      />
    </div>
  </button>
</div>
```

In this code, `md:inline-block` will make the `div` display inline on medium screens and above, and `block` will make the `div` display as a block (i.e., on a new line) on small screens.

ThomPoppins: that doesnt work

GitHub Copilot: If the `block md:inline-block` classes are not working as expected, it might be due to the structure of your HTML or the styles applied to other elements.

Another approach to make a `div` jump to a new line on small screens is to use CSS Flexbox with responsive design. You can make the parent container a flex container and change the direction of the flex items based on the screen size.

Here's an example:

```jsx
<div className='flex flex-col md:flex-row'>
  <div>Content 1</div>
  <div>Content 2</div>
</div>
```

In this code, `flex flex-col md:flex-row` applies the `flex` property to the container, making it a flex container. `flex-col` stacks the flex items vertically (in a column), and `md:flex-row` stacks the flex items horizontally (in a row) on medium screens and above.

Please replace `'Content 1'` and `'Content 2'` with your actual content. If you're still having issues, please provide more context or the full component code.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain I want this paragraph hidden on small screens

GitHub Copilot: To hide the paragraph on small screens, you can use the responsive design feature of Tailwind CSS. The `hidden` class can be used to hide an element, and the `md:block` class can be used to display the element as a block on medium screens and above.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<p className='md:block hidden'>
  Search any keywords to find the best relevant professionals in your area
  first.
</p>
```

In this code, `md:block` will make the paragraph display as a block on medium screens and above, and `hidden` will hide the paragraph on small screens.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain Write an explanation for the active selection as paragraphs of text.

          type='text'
          value={searchQuery}
        />
```

GitHub Copilot: The selected code is a JSX snippet for an input field in a React component. This input field is used to capture user input for a search query. Here's a breakdown of the key parts:

- `className`: This attribute is used to apply CSS styles to the input field. The classes used here are from Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The classes control various visual aspects of the input field such as height (`h-[50px]`), width (`w-full`), border (`border-2 border-purple-900`), background color (`bg-cyan-100`), padding (`px-4 py-2`), text color (`text-gray-800`), and responsive width on medium and large screens (`md:w-[570px] lg:w-[770px]`).

- `data-testid`: This attribute is used for testing. It provides a way to select the element in automated tests.

- `onBlur` and `onFocus`: These are event handlers that are triggered when the input field loses focus and gains focus, respectively. In both handlers, `event.target.select()` is used to select the text in the input field. In the `onBlur` handler, the placeholder text is set to a specific string. In the `onFocus` handler, the placeholder text is cleared.

- `onChange`: This event handler is triggered when the user types into the input field. It calls the `handleSearchQueryChange` function, which is not shown in the code snippet but presumably updates the state of the component with the new search query.

- `placeholder`: This attribute sets the placeholder text for the input field, which is displayed when the input field is empty and not focused.

- `type`: This attribute sets the type of the input field. In this case, it's set to 'text', which means the input field is a text field.

- `value`: This attribute sets the current value of the input field. It's set to `searchQuery`, which is presumably a state variable in the component that stores the current search query.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain I want the input to be 100% of the width of the parent div which on his turn has to be 100% width of the highest parent div always on a new line beneath the logo

GitHub Copilot: To make the input field take up 100% of the width of its parent `div`, you can use the `w-full` class from Tailwind CSS. This class sets the width of the element to 100% of its parent's width.

To make the parent `div` take up 100% of the width of its highest parent `div` and always appear on a new line beneath the logo, you can use the `w-full` and `block` classes. The `block` class makes the `div` display as a block-level element, which means it will start on a new line and take up the full width available.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```jsx
<div className='w-full block'>
  <div className='w-full'>
    <input
      className='h-[50px] w-full rounded-xl border-2 border-purple-900 bg-cyan-100 px-4 py-2 text-gray-800 focus:bg-white md:w-full lg:w-full md:inline-block md:mr-3 md:mb-0'

          'or example: plumber, electrician, gardener, developer, something else...'
      }}

        event.target.placeholder = ''
      }}

In this code, I've added the `w-full` class to the parent `div` of the input field and replaced `md:w-[570px] lg:w-[770px]` with `md:w-full lg:w-full` in the input field's classes. This will make the input field take up 100% of the width of its parent `div` on all screen sizes.

GitHub Copilot: The error message `React2.useContext(...) is null` suggests that the context you're trying to access with `useContext` is not available. This usually happens when a context consumer (a component that uses `useContext`) is rendered outside of a corresponding context provider.

In your case, the error might be related to the `LinkWithRef` component from `react-router-dom`. This component uses the router context, which should be provided by a `BrowserRouter` or `Router` component.

If your `Navbar` component or any of its children use `Link` or any other routing-related components from `react-router-dom`, you need to make sure that they are rendered within a `BrowserRouter` or `Router` component.

Here's how you can modify your Storybook story to include a `BrowserRouter`:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

// ... rest of your code ...

export const Default = () => (
  <Provider store={mockStore}>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Navbar />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </Provider>
)
```

In this code, `BrowserRouter` is a context provider for the router context. By wrapping `Navbar` with `BrowserRouter`, you ensure that all routing-related components inside `Navbar` can access the router context.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain how should I combine the reducers with combineReducers?

GitHub Copilot: In Redux, `combineReducers` is a utility function to simplify the main reducer function in your application. It takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and creates a function that outputs the corresponding state object.

Here's how you can use `combineReducers`:

```javascript
import { combineReducers } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  userId: userIdReducer,
  user: userReducer,
})

export default rootReducer
```

In this code, `userIdReducer` and `userReducer` are the reducer functions for the `userId` and `user` slices of the state, respectively. You should replace them with your actual reducer functions.

After creating the root reducer, you can use it to create the store:

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import rootReducer from './reducers' // path to your rootReducer

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
})

export default store
```

In this code, `configureStore` is a function from Redux Toolkit that creates a Redux store. It takes a configuration object with a `reducer` property, which should be your root reducer.

ThomPoppins: How do I mock combineReducers in Navbar.stories?

GitHub Copilot: To mock `combineReducers` in your story, you need to create mock reducer functions for each slice of your state that the `Navbar` component interacts with. In your case, it seems like you have a `user` slice.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
import { combineReducers } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

let userReducer = (state = { firstName: 'Thom' }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    default:
      return state
  }
}

let rootReducer = combineReducers({
  user: userReducer,
})

const mockStore = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
})
```

In this code, `userReducer` is a mock reducer function for the `user` slice of the state. It always returns the same state, which has a `firstName` property set to `'Thom'`. `rootReducer` is the combined reducer, created using `combineReducers`.

Please replace `'Thom'` with the actual initial state for the `user` slice in your application. If your `Navbar` component interacts with other slices of the state, you should add corresponding mock reducer functions to `rootReducer`.

In your case, the `userReducer` and `userIdReducer` are passed to `combineReducers`. Make sure that these are valid reducer functions.

A reducer is a function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state. Here's an example of a simple reducer function:

      return { ...state, ...action.payload }

  }
}
```

In this code, `userReducer` is a reducer function for the `user` slice of the state. It takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state based on the action type.

If `userReducer` and `userIdReducer` are imported from another module, make sure that they are exported correctly from that module and imported correctly in your story.

If you're still having issues, please provide the code for `userReducer` and `userIdReducer`.

GitHub Copilot: The error message suggests that Storybook is having trouble loading the `Navbar.stories.jsx` module. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **File or directory does not exist:** Make sure that the `Navbar.stories.jsx` file exists in the `src/components/layout/` directory.

2. **Incorrect file extension:** Ensure that the file extension is correct. If your project is set up to use JavaScript, the file should have a `.js` extension. If it's set up to use JSX, the file should have a `.jsx` extension.

3. **Syntax error in the file:** There might be a syntax error in the `Navbar.stories.jsx` file that's preventing it from being loaded. Check the file for any syntax errors and fix them.

4. **Incorrect import statement:** If `Navbar.stories.jsx` is importing other modules, make sure that the import statements are correct. The paths should be correct, and the imported modules should be exported correctly from their respective files.

ThomPoppins: /explain ';' expected., Parsing error: Unexpected token :

GitHub Copilot: The error message is indicating that there's a syntax error in your `mockStore` object. The `getState` function should return an object, but the return statement is missing the `return` keyword and the parentheses around the object.

Here's how you can fix it:

```jsx
const mockStore = {
  getState: () => ({
    user: {
      id: '1',
      firstName: 'Test',
    },
  }),
}
```

In this code, `getState` is a function that returns an object. The object has a `user` property, which is another object with `id` and `firstName` properties. The parentheses around the object are necessary to distinguish the object literal from a block of code.

GitHub Copilot: The error message suggests that there's a component in your application that's causing an infinite loop of updates. This usually happens when a component's state or props are updated in a way that causes the component to re-render, and the update is triggered again during the re-render.

In your case, the issue might be related to the `Provider` component from `react-redux`. This component expects a Redux store as its `store` prop, but you're passing a mock store object. The `Provider` component might be trying to interact with the mock store as if it was a real Redux store, causing unexpected behavior.

Instead of creating a mock store object manually, you can use the `configureStore` function from Redux Toolkit to create a mock store. This function creates a Redux store that behaves like a real one, but allows you to specify the initial state.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const mockStore = configureStore({
  preloadedState: {
    userId: 'dkfjhk3h4ukh5k',
    user: {
      id: '1',
      firstName: 'Test',
    },
  },
})
```

In this code, `configureStore` is a function that creates a Redux store. It takes a configuration object with a `preloadedState` property, which should be the initial state of the store. The `preloadedState` is an object with `userId` and `user` properties, which are the slices of the state that your `Navbar` component interacts with.

Please replace `'dkfjhk3h4ukh5k'`, `'1'`, and `'Test'` with the actual initial state for the `userId` and `user` slices in your application. If your `Navbar` component interacts with other slices of the state, you should add them to `preloadedState`.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain How do I spread this column over all columns

GitHub Copilot: To make a table header (`<th>`) span across all columns in a table, you can use the `colSpan` attribute. The `colSpan` attribute specifies how many columns a cell should span.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<th className='text-2xl' colSpan='5'>
  About Me:
</th>
```

In this code, `colSpan="5"` means that the table header will span across 5 columns. Replace `5` with the actual number of columns in your table.

Remember that the `colSpan` attribute only works if there are enough columns in the table. If there are not enough columns, the cell will only span across the available columns.

ThomPoppins: what is a onboarding page?

GitHub Copilot: An onboarding page is a series of screens (also known as walkthroughs or tutorials) that guide users through the features of an application. They are typically displayed to new users when they first launch the app. The purpose of an onboarding page is to introduce the main features and benefits of the app, demonstrate how to use it, and help users understand how the app can serve their needs. This can help improve user engagement and retention.

ThomPoppins: /explain Missing an explicit type attribute for button

GitHub Copilot: The warning message you're seeing is suggesting that your button element is missing an explicit `type` attribute. In HTML, the `<button>` element has a `type` attribute which specifies the type of the button. The possible values are:

- `submit`: The button submits the form data to the server. This is the default if the attribute is not specified, or if the attribute is dynamically changed to an empty or invalid value.
- `reset`: The button resets all the controls to their initial values.
- `button`: The button has no default behavior. It can have client-side scripts associated with the element's events, which are triggered when the events occur.

In your case, if the `handleSaveUser` function is meant to submit a form, you should add `type="submit"` to the button:

```jsx
<button
  className='m-8 rounded-lg bg-gradient-to-r from-violet-600 to-purple-600 p-2 hover:bg-purple-700 hover:bg-gradient-to-l'
  data-testid='user-register-button'
  onClick={handleSaveUser}
  type='submit'
>
  Save
</button>
```

If the button is not meant to submit a form, you should add `type="button"` to prevent any default form submission behavior:

```jsx
<button
  className='m-8 rounded-lg bg-gradient-to-r from-violet-600 to-purple-600 p-2 hover:bg-purple-700 hover:bg-gradient-to-l'
  data-testid='user-register-button'
  onClick={handleSaveUser}
  type='button'
>
  Save
</button>
```

Adding an explicit `type` attribute to your buttons is a good practice because it makes your code more robust and prevents unexpected form submissions.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'useState' is not defined.

GitHub Copilot: The error message `'useState' is not defined` is indicating that the `useState` function from React is not imported in your file.

The `useState` function is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. To use it, you need to import it from the `react` package.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
```

In this code, `useState` is added to the list of named imports from `react`. Now you can use `useState` in your `CompanyModal` component.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'setLogoId' is missing in props validation

GitHub Copilot: The warning `'setLogoId' is missing in props validation` is coming from the ESLint plugin `eslint-plugin-react`, specifically the rule `react/prop-types`. This rule checks that all props used in a component are validated in the component's propTypes.

In your case, it's indicating that the prop `setLogoId` is not defined in the propTypes of the component where it's being used.

Here's how you can add it to propTypes:

```jsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

// ... rest of your component code ...

YourComponent.propTypes = {
  setLogoId: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
}
```

In this code, `YourComponent` should be replaced with the name of your component. `setLogoId` is defined as a required function prop. If the `setLogoId` prop is not provided or if it's not a function, a warning will be logged in the console.

Remember to import the `prop-types` package at the top of your file. If it's not already installed, you can install it with `npm install prop-types`.

ThomPoppins: /explain Expected to return a value at the end of async arrow function.

GitHub Copilot: The warning "Expected to return a value at the end of async arrow function" is coming from the ESLint rule `consistent-return`. This rule enforces that every code path in a function should return a value.

In your case, the async function passed to `router.post` returns a response in the `if` block, but doesn't return anything if the `if` condition is not met. This means that there's a code path that doesn't return a value.

To fix this, you should add a return statement at the end of the function. This return statement should handle the case where the `if` condition is not met. For example, you could return a 200 status code and a success message:

```javascript
router.post('/', async (request, response) => {
  // ... rest of your code ...

  if (!request.body.username || /* ... rest of your conditions ... */) {
    // ... your existing code ...
  }

  // Handle the case where the if condition is not met
  return response.status(200).send({
    message: 'User registration successful.',
  });
});
```

In this code, `response.status(200).send({ message: 'User registration successful.' })` is a return statement that sends a 200 status code and a success message. This return statement is executed if the `if` condition is not met.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain if the userId is userId of a object in the owners array in the companyDocument, then return status 200 true

GitHub Copilot: To check if the `userId` is in the `owners` array of the `companyDocument` and return a status of 200 if it is, you can use the `Array.prototype.includes()` method. This method checks if an array includes a certain value among its entries.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
router.get('/check-owner', async (req, res) => {
  const { userId } = req.body

  // Fetch the companyDocument from the database
  const companyDocument = await getCompanyDocument()

  if (companyDocument.owners.includes(userId)) {
    return res.status(200).json({ isOwner: true })
  } else {
    return res.status(200).json({ isOwner: false })
  }
})
```

In this code, `getCompanyDocument` is a function that fetches the `companyDocument` from the database. You should replace it with the actual function or method you're using to fetch the `companyDocument`.

The `Array.prototype.includes()` method is used to check if `userId` is in the `owners` array. If it is, the function returns a response with a status of 200 and a JSON object with `isOwner: true`. If it's not, the function returns a response with a status of 200 and a JSON object with `isOwner: false`.

ThomPoppins: /explain Visible, non-interactive elements with click handlers must have at least one keyboard listener.

GitHub Copilot: The warning "Visible, non-interactive elements with click handlers must have at least one keyboard listener" is coming from the ESLint plugin `jsx-a11y`, specifically the rule `jsx-a11y/click-events-have-key-events`. This rule enforces that elements with a `onClick` handler also have a handler for keyboard events such as `onKeyPress`, `onKeyDown`, or `onKeyUp`.

In your case, the warning is likely related to the `div` element with the `onClick` handler. This `div` element is non-interactive (it doesn't have a role that would make it focusable and interactive, like `button` or `a`), but it has a click handler. According to the `jsx-a11y/click-events-have-key-events` rule, it should also have a keyboard event handler.

Here's how you can add an `onKeyPress` handler to the `div`:

```jsx
<div
  className='relative m-4 flex h-auto w-[600px] max-w-full flex-col rounded-lg border-2 border-purple-900 bg-violet-950/40 px-4 py-2'
  data-testid='company-modal'
  key={result._id}
  onClick={(event) => event.stopPropagation()}
  onKeyPress={(event) => {
    if (event.key === 'Enter') {
      event.stopPropagation();
    }
  }}
  role='button'
  tabIndex={0}
>
```

In this code, `onKeyPress` is a function that stops the propagation of the event if the pressed key is 'Enter'. This makes the `div` behave like a button when the 'Enter' key is pressed.

Remember to add `role='button'` and `tabIndex={0}` to make the `div` focusable and interactive. Without these attributes, the `div` wouldn't be focusable, and the `onKeyPress` handler wouldn't work.

GitHub Copilot: The error "Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop." typically occurs when a state update function (like `setBackbuttonLink` in your case) is called inside the body of a function component or a hook, causing the component to re-render, and then the state update function is called again during the re-render, causing an infinite loop of re-renders.

In your code, the `setBackbuttonLink` function is called inside the body of the component, which might be causing the infinite loop of re-renders. To fix this, you should call `setBackbuttonLink` inside a `useEffect` hook. The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in function components, and it's the correct place to call state update functions that depend on props or state.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import { useEffect } from 'react'

// ... rest of your component code ...

useEffect(() => {
  const referrer = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('referrer')

  if (referrer) {
    setBackbuttonLink(`/find?query=${referrer}`)
  }
}, [])
```

In this code, `useEffect` is a function that takes a callback function and a dependency array as arguments. The callback function is executed after the component renders. The dependency array is empty, which means that the callback function is executed only once, after the initial render. This prevents the infinite loop of re-renders.

ThomPoppins: @workspace /explain ## Missing rate limiting

This route handler performs [a database access](1), but is not rate-limited.

[Show more details](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN_STACK_PROJ./security/code-scanning/3817)

GitHub Copilot: Rate limiting is a technique for preventing API abuse by ensuring a client can only make a certain number of requests in a given amount of time. It's important for protecting your server resources and maintaining the quality of service for all users.

In your code, the route handler for `GET /:id` doesn't have rate limiting. This means that a client could potentially make a large number of requests to this route in a short amount of time, which could overload your server or exhaust your database resources.

You can add rate limiting to this route with the `express-rate-limit` package. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit'

const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again after 15 minutes',
})

router.get('/:id', apiLimiter, async (request, response) => {
  // ... rest of your route handler code ...
})
```

In this code, `rateLimit` is a function that creates a rate limiter middleware. The `windowMs` option specifies the duration in milliseconds for which the maximum number of requests is counted. The `max` option specifies the maximum number of requests allowed in `windowMs`. The `message` option specifies the message to send back to the client when they hit the rate limit.

The `apiLimiter` middleware is then used in the `GET /:id` route. This applies the rate limit to this route.

Remember to install the `express-rate-limit` package with `npm install express-rate-limit` if it's not already installed.

ThomPoppins: What kind of options does rateLimit left?

ThomPoppins: What kind of options has rateLimit left from the express-rate-limit package left?

GitHub Copilot: Sorry, but I can only assist with programming related questions.

ThomPoppins: What kind of configurations has rateLimit left from the express-rate-limit package left?

GitHub Copilot: The `express-rate-limit` package provides several options for configuration:

1. `windowMs`: The duration in milliseconds for which the maximum number of requests is counted.

2. `max`: The maximum number of requests allowed in `windowMs`.

3. `message`: The message to send back to the client when they hit the rate limit.

4. `headers`: Whether to include rate limit headers in the response. If true, the middleware adds `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers.

5. `skip`: A function that takes the request and response objects as arguments and returns a boolean. If it returns true, the request is not counted towards the rate limit.

6. `keyGenerator`: A function that takes the request and response objects as arguments and returns a key that uniquely identifies the client. This key is used to count the requests.

7. `handler`: A function that's executed when the client hits the rate limit. By default, it sends a 429 status code and a "Too many requests, please try again later." message.

8. `onLimitReached`: A function that's executed the first time the client hits the rate limit within `windowMs`.

9. `draft_polli_ratelimit_headers`: Whether to include the draft RateLimit headers.

10. `statusCode`: The status code to send when the client hits the rate limit. The default is 429.

11. `skipFailedRequests`: Whether to count failed requests towards the rate limit. If true, failed requests are not counted.

12. `skipSuccessfulRequests`: Whether to count successful requests towards the rate limit. If true, successful requests are not counted.

Remember to check the [official documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit) for the most up-to-date information.

ThomPoppins: how do I whitelist my ip with skip: A function that takes the request and response objects as arguments and returns a boolean. If it returns true, the request is not counted towards the rate limit.

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `skip` option to whitelist your IP. The `skip` option is a function that takes the request and response objects as arguments and returns a boolean. If it returns `true`, the request is not counted towards the rate limit.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
  // 15 minutes:
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs:
  max: 300,
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again after 15 minutes',
  // The rest of the options:
  headers: true,
  skip: function (req, res) {
    // Replace 'YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE' with your IP address
    return req.ip === 'YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE'
  },
})
```

In this code, `skip` is a function that checks if `req.ip` (the IP address of the client) is equal to your IP address. If it is, the function returns `true`, and the request is not counted towards the rate limit. This effectively whitelists your IP address.

Remember to replace `'YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE'` with your actual IP address.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'setLogoUrl' is missing in props validation

GitHub Copilot: The warning "'setLogoUrl' is missing in props validation" is coming from the ESLint plugin `react/prop-types`. This rule enforces that all props used in a component are validated in the component's propTypes.

In your case, the `setLogoUrl` prop is used in the `EditCompanyLogoModal` component, but it's not validated in the component's propTypes. To fix this, you should add `setLogoUrl` to the propTypes of the `EditCompanyLogoModal` component.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

// ... rest of your component code ...

EditCompanyLogoModal.propTypes = {
  onClose: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  setLogoId: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  setLogoUrl: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
}
```

In this code, `PropTypes.func.isRequired` is a propType that specifies that the prop is a function and is required. This means that the `EditCompanyLogoModal` component must receive `onClose`, `setLogoId`, and `setLogoUrl` props, and they must be functions.

Remember to install the `prop-types` package with `npm install prop-types` if it's not already installed.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'disabled' is missing in props validation

GitHub Copilot: The warning "'disabled' is missing in props validation" is coming from the ESLint plugin `react/prop-types`. This rule enforces that all props used in a component are validated in the component's propTypes.

In your case, the `disabled` prop is used in the `MainSearch` component, but it's not validated in the component's propTypes. To fix this, you should add `disabled` to the propTypes of the `MainSearch` component.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

// ... rest of your component code ...

MainSearch.propTypes = {
  disabled: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,
  findButtonPing: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  handleFind: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  handleSearchQueryChange: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  searchQuery: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
}
```

In this code, `PropTypes.bool.isRequired` is a propType that specifies that the prop is a boolean and is required. This means that the `MainSearch` component must receive a `disabled` prop, and it must be a boolean.

Remember to install the `prop-types` package with `npm install prop-types` if it's not already installed.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'isDisabled' is missing in props validation

GitHub Copilot: The warning "'isDisabled' is missing in props validation" is coming from the ESLint plugin `react/prop-types`. This rule enforces that all props used in a component are validated in the component's propTypes.

In your case, the `isDisabled` prop is used in the `MainSearch` component, but it's not validated in the component's propTypes. To fix this, you should add `isDisabled` to the propTypes of the `MainSearch` component.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

// ... rest of your component code ...

MainSearch.propTypes = {
  isDisabled: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,
  findButtonPing: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  handleFind: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  handleSearchQueryChange: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  searchQuery: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
}
```

In this code, `PropTypes.bool.isRequired` is a propType that specifies that the prop is a boolean and is required. This means that the `MainSearch` component must receive an `isDisabled` prop, and it must be a boolean.

Remember to install the `prop-types` package with `npm install prop-types` if it's not already installed.

ThomPoppins: I want to make a grid of SearchResult components on wide screeens 3 next to each other and smaller 2, how?

GitHub Copilot: You can achieve this by using CSS Grid. You can set the `display` property of the parent container to `grid` and use the `grid-template-columns` property to specify the number of columns.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<div
  style={{
    display: 'grid',
    gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr))',
    gap: '1rem',
  }}
>
  {results.map((result) => (
    <SearchResult
      key={result._id}
      navigateToCompanyDetails={navigateToCompanyDetails}
      result={result}
    />
  ))}
</div>
```

In this code, `display: 'grid'` makes the div a grid container. `gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr))'` creates as many columns as can fit without any of them being less than 300px wide. If the container is wider than 900px, this will create 3 columns. If it's between 600px and 900px wide, it will create 2 columns. `gap: '1rem'` sets the gap between grid items to 1rem.

Remember to replace `results` with the actual array of results.

This solution assumes that you're using inline styles. If you're using a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components or emotion, or a CSS preprocessor like Sass, the syntax might be slightly different.

ThomPoppins: How do I implement dot-env in /frontend application

GitHub Copilot: To use environment variables in a frontend application, you can use the `dotenv` package. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the `dotenv` package with `npm install dotenv`.

2. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your environment variables to it. For example:

   ```
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5555
   REACT_APP_TEST_KVK_API=true
   REACT_APP_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL=/placeholders/profile-picture-placeholder-woman.jpeg
   REACT_APP_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL=/placeholders/profile-picture-placeholder-man.jpeg
   ```

   Note: In Create React App, you need to prefix your environment variables with `REACT_APP_` to be able to access them in your application.

3. In your `config.js` file, access the environment variables with `process.env`. For example:

   ```javascript
   export const BACKEND_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
   export const TEST_KVK_API = process.env.REACT_APP_TEST_KVK_API === 'true'
   export const FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL =
     process.env.REACT_APP_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
   export const MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL =
     process.env.REACT_APP_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
   ```

   Note: `process.env.REACT_APP_TEST_KVK_API` will be a string, so you need to compare it to `'true'` to get a boolean.

4. Now you can use your environment variables in your application. Remember to add your `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing it to your repository.

Remember to restart your development server after adding or changing environment variables.

ThomPoppins: /explain 'process' is not defined.

GitHub Copilot: The warning "'process' is not defined" is coming from ESLint. It's because `process` is a global object in Node.js, but ESLint doesn't know about it by default.

In a Create React App project, you can use `process.env` to access environment variables in your JavaScript code. Create React App includes the necessary webpack configuration to define the `process.env` object.

To fix the ESLint warning, you can add a global comment at the top of your file:

```javascript
/* global process */

export const BACKEND_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
export const TEST_KVK_API = process.env.REACT_APP_TEST_KVK_API === 'true'
export const FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL =
  process.env.REACT_APP_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
export const MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL =
  process.env.REACT_APP_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
```

This tells ESLint that `process` is a global variable and it's not undefined.

Alternatively, you can add `node: true` to the `env` section of your ESLint configuration file:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es6": true,
    "node": true
  }
}
```

This tells ESLint that your code will run in a Node.js environment, which defines the `process` global object.

ThomPoppins: Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined
<anonymous> http://localhost:5173/config.js:3
config.js:3:28
<anonymous> http://localhost:5173/config.js:3

GitHub Copilot: The error "Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined" is thrown because the `process` object is a global object provided by Node.js, and it's not available in the browser.

In a Create React App project, webpack replaces every instance of `process.env` with a string literal at build time, and this is why you can use `process.env` in your code even though it runs in the browser.

However, in a Vite project, you need to prefix your environment variables with `VITE_` to make them available in your code. Vite includes the necessary configuration to replace `import.meta.env` with the actual environment variables at build time.

Here's how you can access environment variables in a Vite project:

```javascript
export const BACKEND_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL
export const TEST_KVK_API = import.meta.env.VITE_TEST_KVK_API === 'true'
export const FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL = import.meta.env
  .VITE_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
export const MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL = import.meta.env
  .VITE_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL
```

In your `.env` file, remember to prefix your environment variables with `VITE_`:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5555
VITE_TEST_KVK_API=true
VITE_FEMALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL=/placeholders/profile-picture-placeholder-woman.jpeg
VITE_MALE_PROFILE_PICTURE_PLACEHOLDER_URL=/placeholders/profile-picture-placeholder-man.jpeg
```

Remember to restart your development server after adding or changing environment variables.
