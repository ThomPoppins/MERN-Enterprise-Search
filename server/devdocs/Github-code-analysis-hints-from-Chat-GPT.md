As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there are several free code analysis tools and services you can use for your GitHub repository. Keep in mind that the landscape of development tools is constantly evolving, so it's a good idea to check for the latest tools and configurations. Here's a general approach to setting up code analysis for your GitHub repository:

1. **GitHub Actions**: GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that allows you to set up workflows for your repository. You can use it to run code analysis tools and checks on your codebase automatically whenever you push changes.

2. **ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript**: If your project is primarily JavaScript or TypeScript, ESLint is a popular code analysis tool for detecting and fixing problems in your code. You can configure ESLint to your liking and run it as part of your CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

3. **Prettier for Code Formatting**: Prettier is a code formatter that can automatically format your code to adhere to a consistent style guide. It works well in combination with ESLint.

4. **SonarQube**: SonarQube is an open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. It supports multiple languages and can provide detailed reports on code quality issues.

Here's a basic example of how you can set up ESLint and Prettier with GitHub Actions for your repository:

**Step 1:** Create a `.github/workflows/code-analysis.yml` file in your repository with the following content:

```yaml
name: Code Analysis

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: 14

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run ESLint and Prettier
        run: npm run lint # Assuming you have npm scripts set up for linting
```

**Step 2:** Make sure your project has ESLint and Prettier configured. You can create a `.eslintrc.js` file for ESLint and a `.prettierrc.js` file for Prettier in your project root directory.

**Step 3:** Create a script in your `package.json` to run ESLint and Prettier:

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint . --fix",
  "format": "prettier --write ."
}
```

With this setup, every push to the `main` branch will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow, which will install dependencies, run ESLint, and format your code using Prettier.

Remember that this is a basic example, and you can customize it further to fit your specific needs and include other code analysis tools as necessary.

For more advanced code analysis and reports, you can explore tools like SonarQube and integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline as well. Always refer to the official documentation of the tools and services you use for the most up-to-date instructions and configurations.
