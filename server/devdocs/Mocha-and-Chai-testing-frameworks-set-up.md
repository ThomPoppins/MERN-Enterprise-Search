### GitHub Copilot: To set up Mocha and Chai for writing tests for your Express.js API endpoints in `booksRoute.js`, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Mocha and Chai as development dependencies using npm:

   ```
   npm install mocha chai --save-dev
   ```

2. Create a new folder called `test` in your project root directory.

3. Inside the `test` folder, create a new file called `booksRoute.test.js`.

4. In `booksRoute.test.js`, require the necessary modules:

   ```javascript
   const chai = require('chai')
   const chaiHttp = require('chai-http')
   const app = require('../app')

   const expect = chai.expect

   chai.use(chaiHttp)
   ```

5. Write your tests using the `describe` and `it` functions provided by Mocha:

   ```javascript
   describe('Books API', function () {
     it('should return all books', function (done) {
       chai
         .request(app)
         .get('/books')
         .end(function (err, res) {
           expect(res).to.have.status(200)
           expect(res.body).to.be.an('array')
           done()
         })
     })

     it('should add a new book', function (done) {
       chai
         .request(app)
         .post('/books')
         .send({
           title: 'Test Book',
           author: 'Test Author',
           year: 2021,
         })
         .end(function (err, res) {
           expect(res).to.have.status(201)
           expect(res.body).to.be.an('object')
           expect(res.body.title).to.equal('Test Book')
           expect(res.body.author).to.equal('Test Author')
           expect(res.body.year).to.equal(2021)
           done()
         })
     })

     // Add more tests as needed
   })
   ```

6. Run your tests using the `mocha` command:

   ```
   npm test
   ```

   This will run all the tests in the `test` folder and report the results in the console.

Note that this is just a basic example of how to set up Mocha and Chai for testing your Express.js API endpoints. You may need to modify this setup to fit your specific needs and requirements.

### GitHub Copilot: To set up the `mocha` test command, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your `package.json` file.

2. Add a new script called `test` to the `scripts` section:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "test": "mocha"
   }
   ```

   This tells npm to run the `mocha` command when you run `npm test`.

3. Save the `package.json` file.

4. Open your terminal or command prompt.

5. Run the following command to install Mocha as a development dependency:

   ```
   npm install mocha --save-dev
   ```

6. Create a new folder called `test` in your project root directory.

7. Inside the `test` folder, create a new file called `booksRoute.test.js`.

8. Write your tests in `booksRoute.test.js`.

9. Run your tests by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   npm test
   ```

   This will run all the tests in the `test` folder and report the results in the console.

Note that this is just a basic example of how to set up the `mocha` test command. You may need to modify this setup to fit your specific needs and requirements.
