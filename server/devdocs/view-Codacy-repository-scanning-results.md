GitHub Copilot: To view the results of the Codacy security scan in your GitHub repository, you can use the Codacy GitHub app.

Once you have set up the Codacy security scan action in your repository, Codacy will automatically analyze your code and provide feedback on any issues it finds. You can view the results of the analysis in the Codacy dashboard.

To view the results of the analysis in your GitHub repository, you can install the Codacy GitHub app. The app will display the results of the analysis directly in your GitHub repository, allowing you to see any issues and take action to address them.

To install the Codacy GitHub app, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Codacy GitHub app page: https://github.com/apps/codacy

2. Click the "Install" button and select the repository you want to install the app for.

3. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

Once the app is installed, you can view the results of the Codacy security scan in your GitHub repository by going to the "Checks" tab on the pull request or commit page. The app will display any issues found by the security scan, along with information on how to address them.

You can also configure the Codacy GitHub app to send notifications when new issues are found, so you can stay up-to-date on any security vulnerabilities in your code. To configure notifications, go to the Codacy dashboard and click on the "Notifications" tab. From there, you can configure the app to send notifications to your email or Slack channel.
