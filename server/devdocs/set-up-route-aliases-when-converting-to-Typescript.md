GitHub Copilot: The error "Import path must be a path alias" in Codacy usually occurs when you are using an import statement that does not use a path alias.

In your case, the error is occurring on the line `import booksRoute from "./routes/booksRoute.js"` in your `index.js` file. This error is likely being raised because the import statement is not using a path alias.

To fix this error, you can try using a path alias in your import statement. For example, if you have set up a path alias for your `routes` directory called `@routes`, you can modify the import statement like this:

```javascript
import booksRoute from '@routes/booksRoute.js'
```

This will use the `@routes` path alias instead of the relative path `./routes`.

If you have not set up a path alias, you can do so by modifying the `baseUrl` and `paths` properties in your `tsconfig.json` file. Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@routes/*": ["./routes/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration sets up a path alias called `@routes` that maps to the `./routes` directory. Once you have set up the path alias, you can use it in your import statements to avoid the "Import path must be a path alias" error.
