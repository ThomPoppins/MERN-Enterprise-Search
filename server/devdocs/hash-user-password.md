GitHub Copilot: To hash a user's password on registration and compare the hashed password on login, you can use a library such as `bcrypt` in your Node.js application.

Here's an example of how you can use `bcrypt` to hash a user's password on registration:

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt')

// ...

app.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body

  // Hash password
  const saltRounds = 10
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds)

  // Save user to database with hashed password
  const user = new User({ username, password: hashedPassword })
  await user.save()

  res.json({ message: 'User registered successfully' })
})
```

In this example, the `bcrypt` library is used to hash the user's password with a salt of 10 rounds. The hashed password is then saved to the database along with the user's other information.

To compare the hashed password on login, you can use the `bcrypt.compare()` method to compare the user's input password with the hashed password stored in the database. Here's an example:

```javascript
app.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body

  // Find user by username
  const user = await User.findOne({ username })
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid username or password' })
  }

  // Compare password
  const isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password)
  if (!isPasswordValid) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid username or password' })
  }

  // Generate JWT and send as response
  // ...
})
```

In this example, the `User` model is used to find the user with the specified username. The `bcrypt.compare()` method is then used to compare the user's input password with the hashed password stored in the database. If the passwords match, the user is authenticated and a JWT can be generated and sent as a response.

By using `bcrypt` to hash and compare passwords, you can ensure that user passwords are securely stored in the database and that only authorized users can log in to your application.
