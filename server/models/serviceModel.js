/*
 * TODO: [MERNSTACK-52] Create a new schema and model for services. If more than one company would associate to a service, they have to create a project together and work from there. The services from a project should also (optionally) be visible on the associated company profiles.
 * TODO: [MERNSTACK-53] Make it possible for users to contact a company for about a service with chat and video call (maybe chat and video calls should be a premium features, decide about this later).
 * TODO: [MERNSTACK-54] A appointment can be made with a company, with the advantage that the service delivered to the customer can be linked to a story on the company/project profile page. The customer, employee, vendor, product, service, and more can be linked to the story and leave their part of the message, this way a customer (user) can maybe have a beneficial price in return for a review with rating.
 * TODO: [MERNSTACK-55] Think about how to make appointments with companies, how the agenda model and schema should look like, and how to link appointments to stories.
 * TODO: [MERNSTACK-56] Make it possible for employees to respond on service contact chat/video call requests, and make appointments with customers. (premium feature? Maybe "bronze": 2 employees, "silver": 5 employees, "gold": 10 employees, "platinum": 20 employees, "astronomical": unlimited, something like that.)
