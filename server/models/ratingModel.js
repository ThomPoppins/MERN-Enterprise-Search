 * TODO: [MERNSTACK-73] Create a new schema and model for `rating`. Ratings will be linked to a company, based on an ratingId in the rating model. This model should contain the rating number, reviewer, timestamp and maybe more.
 * TODO: [MERNSTACK-78] Think about ways to reward users that leave honest ratings. Think about ways to punish those who only leave trolling ratings and reviews with the intention to give one or more businesses a bad name or harass companies.)
