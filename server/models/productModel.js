 * TODO: [MERNSTACK-45] Create a new schema and model for products. If more than one company would associate to a product, they have to create a project together and work from there. The products from a project should also (optionally) be visible on the associated company profiles.
 * TODO: [MERNSTACK-46] A company product listing page should have a search bar, and a filter for industry, rating, price, and more.
 * TODO: [MERNSTACK-47] It should be possible to search for products without having to visit a company profile. (search bar on the home page)
 * TODO: [MERNSTACK-48] Make product listing something companies can pay for. (premium feature) IMPORTANT: Make sure that the users finds what they search for, that should have BIG priority over paid listings that will feel unpleasant and not logical.
 * TODO: [MERNSTACK-49] A product page should also have reviews from customers. (maybe also from employees and vendors?)
 * TODO: [MERNSTACK-50] IMPORTANT! Find out how to use a "junction table" to link companies to products and products to projects. (many-to-many relationship)
