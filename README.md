Picture this: we're delving deep into the MERN stack, leveraging React (yup, we've got Redux for the ultimate state management party) on the client side. Our ExpressJS backend is the backstage maestro, serving up API endpoints on Node.js and ensuring our data seamlessly moves between the client and MongoDB database. And hey, we've got the NPM Mongoose package ‚Äì our secret sauce for authenticated data transfer magic! üé©üêç

But here's the exciting part! This application isn't just any project; it's a vision. We're dreaming big ‚Äì envisioning a globally recognized platform that not only elevates lives with killer functionalities but also delivers an experience that's as social and enjoyable as your favorite Friday night plans. üåçüöÄ

Let me spill the beans on a game-changer feature: our app is a search engine for registered companies. Companies can register for free! The search results are revolutionary; we sort companies by their ratings and relevance. It's way better than sifting through Google to find services or products‚Äîour approach ensures you always discover the best-rated, most relevant companies.

Sure, the road ahead might be a bit of a rollercoaster, but guess what? I'm psyched about every twist and turn. And I want you to be a part of it!

### üè† **Homepage Exploration:**

When you're logged in, the homepage transforms into a powerful search engine for finding professionals with expertise. It's like a search superpower for users seeking skilled individuals.

![Search Engine in Action](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/001.png?raw=true)

### üßë‚Äçüíº **Profile Page Magic:**

Right after you sign up, your profile is pretty empty, and your profile picture is a stand-in - a male image for guys and a female image for gals.

![Profile Placeholder](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/002.png?raw=true)

### üåê **Uploading Your Profile Pic:**

Once you log in for the first time, just hit the `upload` button on the placeholder profile picture. A window will pop up, letting you pick an image from your device. Click on `browse...`, and voila! Your picture is ready to roll.

![Upload Modal](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/003.png?raw=true)

### üñºÔ∏è **Preview Before You Commit:**

After you choose an image from your device, you get a sneak peek. You can change your mind or cancel the upload if the image isn't quite what you had in mind.

![Picture Preview](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/004.png?raw=true)

And hey, if you want, you can still swap it out or hit the cancel button before the image is uploaded. Oh, and that preview? It's like a secret code, but for images.

### üé® **Decoding BLOB: What's the Binary Large Object?**

Here's the lowdown: a BLOB is a fancy term for a collection of binary data stored as one unit. Usually, it's images, audio, or other cool stuff. Sometimes, even secret binary codes chill out in a BLOB.

```javascript
<img src={blobValueString} />
```

**Source:** [_/client/src/components/users/EditProfilePicture.jsx_](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/client/src/components/users/EditProfilePictureModal.jsx)

In case you're curious about the code behind the scenes, there's a script called `EditProfilePictureModal` that handles all the picture-editing magic. It's like the conductor of the image orchestra.


**Explore New Features**

### 1. Search Functionality

- **Find Companies:** Users can search for companies by their names.
- **Organized Results:** Search results are neatly displayed in a grid format with company images.
- **Easy Navigation:** Clicking on a company takes you to a detailed page about that company (Company Profile).
- **Privacy Control:** If you're a member of the company (owner, employee, admin), you'll see private details on the company profile page.

> **Note:** The search button is only clickable when there's a search input value. Check out the image below for reference:

**Image Cropping Made Easy**

- **Upload and Crop:**
  - Users can upload an image and easily crop it by dragging or selecting a file.
  - The preview shows how the crop will look in a circular shape.
- **Set as Profile Picture:**
  - The cropped image becomes the default profile picture.
- **Download Option:**
  - After cropping, users can download the cropped image file.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Cropped images are transformed into a special format (BLOB) and sent to the server (Express.js).
  - The server then serves these images as static files for the frontend.

> **Example Scenario:**
>
> ![New User Profile Page](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/image-crop-001-new-user.png?raw=true)

**Creating and Downloading a Cropped Image:**

1. **After clicking 'Download Cropped Image':**
   - A special file (Blob) is created from the previewed canvas using the canvas API.
   - This Blob file is a raw data representation of the cropped image.

```javascript
// JavaScript function to create a blob from the canvas and download it as a PNG file
function generateDownload(canvas, crop) {
  if (!crop || !canvas) {
    return
  }

  canvas.toBlob(
    (blob) => {
      const previewUrl = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob)
      const anchor = document.createElement('a')

      anchor.download = 'cropPreview.png'
      anchor.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
      anchor.click()

      window.URL.revokeObjectURL(previewUrl)
    },
    'image/png',
    1,
  )
}
```

2. **Result after Download:**
   - A PNG file is downloaded with the cropped image.

![Download PNG Cropped Image Result](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/image-crop-007-result-downloaded-cropped-image-png.png?raw=true)

3. **Uploading the Cropped Image:**
   - When the user clicks 'Upload' after cropping, a Blob binary object is generated.
   - This Blob object is then written to an image file in PNG format.
   - The image file is uploaded to the Express.js server.

```jsx
// JavaScript function to save the cropped image to the server
const saveProfileImage = (canvas, completedCrop) => {
  if (!completedCrop || !canvas) {
    return
  }

  canvas.toBlob(
    (blob) => {
      const formData = new FormData()
      const file = new File([blob], 'profile-picture.png')
      formData.append('image', file)

      axios
        .post(`${BACKEND_URL}/upload/image`, formData, {
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
          },
        })
        .then((response) => {
          // Update user profile picture information in the database
          // and refresh the user's data on the frontend.
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          // Handle any errors that may occur during the upload process.
        })
    },
    'image/png',
    1,
  )
}
```

4. **Backend Processing:**
   - On the server side (Express.js), the uploaded image is handled using Multer.
   - The file is named, given a destination, and stored in the "/public/uploads/images" folder.
   - The server responds with details about the uploaded image.

```jsx
// Express.js route for handling image uploads
router.post(
  '/image',
  apiLimiter,
  upload.single('image'),
  async (request, response) => {
    // If the file upload was successful, the file will be stored in the "uploads/images" folder.
    // A response is sent back to the client with image path, URL, and database Image._id.
  },
)
```

5. **Result after Uploading:**
   - The user's profile picture is updated and utilized.

## Simplified Explanation:

**Improvements in the System:**

### Professions in Company Schema

- **New Company Information:**
  - Added a spot for "professions" in the company details.
  - Companies can now list their professions during sign-up.
  - This enhances search results, making them more relevant and dynamic.

### Storybook Integration

- **Developer-Friendly Environment:**
  - Set up Storybook for creating and testing components.
  - Introduced initial components to Storybook for development and testing.

### Testing

- **Ensuring Quality:**
  - Installed Jest and React-Testing-Library for thorough component testing.
  - Work is ongoing to create tests for almost every component.

### Animations

- **Enhanced User Experience:**
  - Introduced subtle animations for a more engaging interface.
  - Notifications now have attention-grabbing animations:
    - When an invite is pending, the user's name in the navigation bar wiggles.
    - Dropdown menu has a lively "Invites" item that jumps, directing the user to pending invites.

**Tailwind CSS Animation Tweaks:**

- **More Joyful Animations:**
  - Tweaked preinstalled Tailwind animations for a livelier and more joyful feel.
  - Examples include waving, bouncing, spinning, and ping animations.

### Co-Ownership Invites

- **Interactive Invitations:**
  - Notification icon wiggles for co-ownership invites.
  - Dynamically added "Invites" to the dropdown menu.
  - Attention-grabbing jump animation for pending co-ownership invites.
  - Users can accept or decline invites.
  - After responding to all invites, users are redirected to a page listing the companies they now co-own.
  - Implemented safety measures to avoid duplicate invitations and ensure unique co-ownership status.

![Demo](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/GIF/Invites-animation.gif?raw=true)

### User profile page and data structure

_Profile page:_
![Profile Page With Profile Picture](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/005.png?raw=true)

At this point there are only a few details a user can set when registering a new account. Of course this will be expend (largely) in the future. For now in this stage of the development process of the application, it's useful to keep minimalistic, clean and keep everything simple now there is not any dependency on yet and over complicate everything. Dependencies for users details could be a detailed profile pages, location/address information, media, posts on a timeline (or feed) or many other things users would want to save personally to their account eventually.

#### `User` schema

**Schema fields:**

- **username**

  - _Type_: String
  - _Required_: true
  - _Unique_: true
  - _Default_: ''

- **email**

  - _Type_: String
  - _Required_: true
  - _Unique_: true
  - _Default_: ''

- **hashedPassword**

  - _Type_: String
  - _Required_: true
  - _Default_: ''

- **firstName**

  - _Type_: String
  - _Required_: true
  - _Default_: ''

- **lastName**

  - _Type_: String
  - _Required_: true
  - _Default_: ''

- **gender**

  - _Type_: String
  - _Required_: true
  - _Description_: Represents the gender of the user. Can be "Man," "Woman," or "Other."

- **profilePicture**
  - _Type_: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId
  - _Ref_: 'Image'
  - _Description:_ This field is an ID reference to the image document in the database image collection, containing the file path local to the CDN (ExpressJS backend) server from which image file is being served. This allows for the image to be retrieved from the CDN (ExpressJS backend server) and displayed on the client-side application page based on a URL relative to the CDN server that can logically be generated from the image document's file path. This way no hard coded URLs are needed to be saved in MongoDB database and the image documents will be served independent of the backend server domain address making the image documents portable and reusable in different production and development environments and allowing easy migration of the image files to a different storage and host with a different URL/domain.

_Additional fields:_

- **timestamps**
  - Type: Object
  - Description: Automatically adds `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to the user doc

**Mongoose:**

- The **Mongoose** schema establishes the data structure for the user information within the database.
- It enforces uniqueness for each user's username and email to prevent double sign-ups and ensuring secure storage of their hashed password.
  User details like `firstName`, `lastName`, `gender`and a reference field to the profile picture image document called `profilePicture`.
- The `User` schema describing the data structure of the MongoDB `User` documents in the `users` collection is defined in the [backend server](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/backend/models/userModel.js).
- The `User` schema is described and defined using Mongoose, a popular _Object Data Modeling (ODM)_ library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- The `User` schema is expected to extends with many fields when continued development will many more dependencies on user data when the application grows and complexity increases.

**Source:** _[/backend/models/userModel.js](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/backend/models/userModel.js)_

```javascript
// Instantiate User schema
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    username: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      unique: true,
      default: '',
    },
    email: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      unique: true,
      default: '',
    },
    hashedPassword: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      default: '',
    },
    firstName: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      default: '',
    },
    lastName: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      default: '',
    },
    gender: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    profilePicture: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'Image',
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true },
)
```

**Mongoose `User` model:**

- The User model is created using the mongoose.model function, which takes the name 'User' and the user schema as arguments.
- This model (`User`) serves as an interface to interact with the MongoDB database based on the defined schema.
- The model (`User`) is directly tied to the schema (`userSchema`).
- When you use methods like User.create(), User.find(), or others, Mongoose ensures that the data aligns with the structure defined in the schema.

> _[/backend/models/userModel.js](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/backend/models/userModel.js):_

```javascript
// Instantiate User model
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema)
```

### Companies

#### Listing page

On the /companies page the user can see all companies that he owns and has the choice between listing the companies in _card_ view or in _table_ view. The view of choice will be saved as a Redux state so the user preference will be kept as long as they are logged in. I am planning to save this configuration to the database so the user preference will never be lost and can be dispatched to the Redux state every time they log in to their account.

> **Note:** I opened the dropdown menu.

_Card view:_
![Companies Listing Page Card View](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/007.png?raw=true)

_Table view:_
![Companies Listing Page Table View](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/006.png?raw=true)

When the user clicks on the _eye_ icon on a listed company, a modal will pop up that will display the main and most important public company information so the owner of the company can check the company current state quickly at a glance without having to navigate to another company specific details page and lose track of what they were doing or planning to do from the companies listing page.

> **Note:** At this stage in development, companies do not have that many details yet to show. There will be a lot of work to these pages yet and they do not reflect a final version.

![Show Company Details Modal](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/008.png?raw=true)

#### Registration

An owner of a company can register his company in my application. On this companies listing page you see a green `+` icon in the top right corner. When a user clicks on that, he will navigate to the company register page where the user can register a new company that hasn't registered yet by filling in a company registration form.

_Company registration form:_
![Company Registration Form Top](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/008.1.png?raw=true)
![Company Registration Form Bottom](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/008.2.png?raw=true)

#### Form field validation

All form input fields in my application have to be validated. I've written my own validators for all fields. I've used regular expressions to make sure it is correct data as I expect to receive from the user input.

**Example validator:**

**Source:** _[/client/utils/validation/emailValidator.js](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/client/src/utils/validation/emailValidator.jsx)_

```javascript
const emailValidator = (email) => {
  const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/u
  return regex.test(email)
}

export default emailValidator
```

**Invalid value notifications:**

![Invalid Values Error Notifications](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/Invalid-Form-Values.png?raw=true)

**Code example communicating invalid values in the UI of company registration page:**

**Source:** _[/client/src/pages/companies/RegisterCompany.jsx](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/client/src/pages/companies/RegisterCompany.jsx)_

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import axios from 'axios'
import { useSnackbar } from 'notistack'
import emailValidator from '../../utils/validation/emailValidator'
// ... (and a lot of other imports and validator imports here)

const RegisterCompany = () => {
 const [name, setName] = useState(''),
 // email form field input value
   [email, setEmail] = useState(''),
   // ... (states for all other form field values)
   // If value is invalid, emailError would become true
   [nameError, setNameError] = useState(false),
   [emailError, setEmailError] = useState(false),
   // ... (errors states for all form fields here)
   // useSnackbar is a hook that allows us to show a notification that pops up in the left bottom corder (see image above)
   { enqueueSnackbar } = useSnackbar()

 // Functions that will call the name and email validators and sets the error state dependent on the return value from the validators.

##### KVK number validation

![Invalid KvK Number](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/Invalid-KvK-Number.png?raw=true)

Companies in the Netherlands (my home country) are always registered to the "Kamer van Koophandel" which is the Chamber of Commerce in the Netherlands. It is a government agency that plays a crucial role in the registration and documentation of businesses operating in my country.

I've connected the backend application to the KvK test API for validation of company KvK numbers. When a user registers a company to my application and fills in the KvK number, when the input field loses focus (`onBlur()`), automatically there will be a request to the KvK (test) API for KvK number validation.

**GET route to get KvK data:**

**Source:** _[/backend/routes/kvkRoute.js](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/backend/routes/kvkRoute.js)_

```javascript
import { getKvkData } from '../controllers/kvkController.js'
import express from 'express'
import cors from 'cors'

const router = express.Router()

// GET route to get KvK data from the KvK API by KvK number
router.get('/', cors(), getKvkData)

export default router
```

**KvK controller for handling request:**

**Source:** _[/backend/controllers/kvkController.js](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/backend/controllers/kvkController.js)_

```javascript
import axios from 'axios'
import fs from 'fs'
import https from 'https'
import { KVK_TEST_API_KEY } from '../config.js'

const PATH_TO_KVK_API_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN_RELATIVE_TO_INDEX_APP =
  './certs/kvkApi/Private_G1_chain.pem'

// Function to get data from the KVK API
export const getKvkData = async (request, response) => {
  try {
    // Get the query from the request query parameters
    const { kvkNumber } = request.query,
      // Get the certificate chain from the file system
      certificateChain = fs.readFileSync(
        PATH_TO_KVK_API_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN_RELATIVE_TO_INDEX_APP,
        'utf8',
      ),
      // Create an https agent with the certificate chain
      // https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_request_options_callback
      agent = new https.Agent({
        ca: certificateChain,
      }),
      // Get the data from the KVK API GET request
      { data } = await axios.get(
        `https://api.kvk.nl/test/api/v1/naamgevingen/kvknummer/${kvkNumber}`,
        {
          headers: {
            apikey: KVK_TEST_API_KEY,
          },
          httpsAgent: agent,
        },
      )

    // Send status 200 response and the data to the client
    return response.status(200).json(data)
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Error in GET /kvk: ', error)
    // If the error is a 400 error, send a 400 response with the error message
    if (error.response.status === 400) {
      return response.status(400).send({ message: error.message })
    }
    // Else, send a 500 response with the error message
    return response.status(500).send({ message: error.message })
  }
}
```

For now, only number validation is enough, but in the future also the company name, owners and other company details will be verified against this API to rule out the need for human verification as much as possible to safe costs and make the user experience a much faster because users can get started with their company in the application right away without having to wait for a manual verification of their business.

**Subsidiary companies:**:
KvK numbers have to be unique so companies can't get registered more then once, in the future this uniqueness has to be combination between Kvk number and company name (and also maybe other company details) because companies can have subsidiary companies with the same number and these subsidiary companies should be able to be registered as valid companies to the application because for a regular user using the app to find a company they need, it is not important to know that a company has a parent company. If companies find it necessary to inform the regular user (and potential customer) about their subsidiarity of a parent company, then they should be able to inform users about that on their company profile page (in very early development).

#### `Company` document data structure

When I first got the business idea for building this application I decided to make companies the main central starting point to focus on, find out what is necessary to get companies on board with my application and want to register and pay for premium features. Almost the first thing I started building was a company model that has all required fields where companies would be dependent on realizing the ideas I have in mind for my application, resulting in a `Company` model with many fields. At this stage of development only a few of there defined fields are actually used and populated with data at the moment, but because it is not a requirement to populate every field with data before saving and editing `Company` documents in the database, I feel no need to simplify the model for the time being at all.

- It enforces uniqueness for each companies' KVK number to prevent double registrations.
- The `Company` model has a lot of fields not being populated with data yet, but the size of this model tells very clearly about what size of the application would become.

**Schema:**

```javascript
// Instantiate `Company` schema
const companySchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    // ... (all schema fields are defined here)
  },
  { timestamps: true },
)
```

> **Note:** To see the complete code of the `Company` schema instantiation with all fields [here](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/backend/models/companyModel.js).

**Model:**

```javascript
// Instantiate `Company` model
const Company = mongoose.model('Company', companySchema)
```

#### Edit company

When a company owner clicks on the _pencil_ icon on the companies listing page the owner is able to edit the company.

#### Company ownership

Companies are automatically owned by the `User` that registers the company to the application.

If a company has more than one owner, the company owners is able to invite other users for company ownership, giving the other co-owners the same admin level elevated access to the configuration of their company.

_Find other users and invite them for co-ownership:_
![Find Other Users For Company Co-ownership](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/Find-Other-Users-For-Company-Co-ownership.png?raw=true)

A company owner can find users of the application with the search box on the "edit company" page and send them a invite by clicking the `invite` button.

When a user is invited by the owner for co-ownership the user "result" will be removed from the search results list and a "Pending invites" section will appear with the invited user. I invited the user Kaya Lowe in this example.

![User Invited On Edit Company Page](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/User-Invited.png?raw=true)

> **Note:** In the future this `Invite` information will be the user details, but I have to make a future decision about where I want this data to be served from the backend to the client application, that's why it is only containing `ObjectId` information of the `Invite` document. See the `Invite` schema data structure [further down below](#invite-schema).

When the `User` is invited to become co-owner of the company, that user will receive a invite notification in the navigation bar.

![User Invited On Edit Company Page](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/Invite-Notification.png?raw=true)

Clicking on the `Invites` dropdown menu item, the user will navigate to the invites page and be able to _Accept_ or _Decline_ the invite by clicking the buttons in the _Operations_ section in the _Invites_ table listing the pending invites.

![Invites Page](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/Invites-Page.png?raw=true)

After clicking _Accept_ or _Decline_ and there is no pending invite left, the user will navigate to the companies listing page and the companies they accepted will be listed there with their name added as co-owner.

![Invite Accepted](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/Invite-Accepted.png?raw=true)

> **Note:** The invite notification has disappeared, the _Invites_ dropdown menu item isn't listing anymore.

After accepting the invite, the _Owners_ section of the _edit company_ page is updated with the new owner and the _Pending invites_ Section disappeared since there are no pending invites left.

![Owners Section Updated](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/Ownership-Section-Updated.png?raw=true)

> **Note:** In React I use _conditional rendering_ and _state management_ to easily always keep the UI up-to-date with the current state of the application when the state (current data) has been changed.

#### `Invite` schema

**Schema fields:**

1. **Sender ID:**

   - Type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId
   - Reference: "User"
   - Description: The ID of the user sending the invitation.

2. **Receiver ID:**

   - Type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId
   - Reference: "User"
   - Description: The ID of the user receiving the invitation.

3. **Kind:**

   - Type: String
   - Description: Specifies the type of invitation, with possible values: "company_ownership", "friend", "other". Default value is "other".

4. **Company ID:**

   - Type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId
   - Reference: "Company"
   - Description: If the invitation is related to company ownership, this field contains the ID of the associated company.

5. **Kind:**

const inviteSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    senderId: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'User',
      required: true,
    },
    receiverId: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'User',
      required: true,
    },
    kind: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      default: 'other',
    },
    companyId: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'Company',
    },
    status: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      default: 'pending',
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true },
)
```

**Model:**

```javascript

#### Logging In

Registered users can log in to their accounts using their previously provided credentials. This allows them to access and utilize all features and services provided by the application. The login process is secure and ensures that only authorized users can access their accounts.

When you log in a JWT token is generated and stored in the browser's local storage. This token is used to authenticate the user and to make sure that the user is authorized to access the application. The token is also used to make sure that the user is authorized to access certain resources in the application. For example, the user can only access his own company resources and not the company resources of other users.

#### Company Registration and Ownership

Upon logging in to their account, users have the capability to register a company that they own. This action automatically designates the user as the owner of the registered company, granting them administrative privileges within the application.

- **Ownership Privileges:** The user, upon registering a company, assumes the role of owner with full administrative control over the company's operations.

##### How to Register a Company

1. Log in to your account.
2. Navigate to Companies
3. Click the plus icon to add a new company.
4. Fill in company details with KVK-number and submit the registration form.

Upon successful registration and validation from the KVK API, the user will be recognized as the owner of the company and will have access to all administrative functionalities associated with it.

##### How to add a co-owner to a company

1. Log in to your account.
2. Navigate to Companies
3. Click the pencil icon to edit a company.
4. Search for a user by name, username or email.

## Technical description:

### Frontend

On the frontend, I've chosen to install React with Vite (_Next Generation Frontend Tooling_) for building user interfaces and Redux for state management.

#### Vite

The React frontend application was installed using Vite.js, a modern build tool that provides fast development server and efficient build process.

- **Faster development:** Vite.js provides a fast development server that supports near-instantaneous hot module replacement (HMR) for React components. This means that changes to your code are reflected in the browser almost immediately, without requiring a full page reload. This can speed up the development process and make it easier to iterate on code.

- **Efficient builds:** Vite.js uses a highly optimized build process that leverages the native ES modules support in modern browsers. This can result in faster build times and smaller bundle sizes compared to other build tools.

- **Modern web technologies:** Vite.js supports modern web technologies out of the box, including ES modules, TypeScript, and CSS modules. This makes it easy to build modern, high-performance web applications.

- **Plugin ecosystem:** Vite.js has a growing ecosystem of plugins that can be used to extend its functionality. This includes plugins for things like CSS preprocessing, image optimization, and more.

#### React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a declarative syntax for defining UI components, and uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI in response to changes in state. Some of the main advantages of React include:

- **Declarative syntax:** React provides a simple and intuitive syntax for defining UI components, making it easy to reason about the structure and behavior of your application.

- **Efficient updates:** React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI in response to changes in state, minimizing the number of DOM manipulations required.

- **Component reusability:** React components are modular and reusable, making it easy to build complex UIs from simple building blocks.

- **Large ecosystem:** React has a large and active ecosystem of libraries and tools, making it easy to find solutions to common problems and integrate with other technologies.

#### Redux

Redux is a state management library that is often used in conjunction with React. It provides a centralized store for managing application state, and uses a unidirectional data flow to ensure that state changes are predictable and easy to reason about. Some of the main advantages of using Redux with React include:

- **Centralized state management:** Redux provides a centralized store for managing application state, making it easy to manage and reason about complex state interactions.

- **Predictable state changes:** Redux uses a unidirectional data flow to ensure that state changes are predictable and easy to reason about, making it easier to debug and maintain your application.

- **Time-travel debugging:** Redux provides a powerful debugging tool called "time-travel debugging", which allows you to step through state changes and see how your application state evolves over time.

- **Ecosystem integration:** React and Redux have large and active ecosystems of libraries and tools, making it easy to integrate with other technologies and solve common problems.

### Backend

In the backend, I've set up RESTful API endpoints to create, read, update, and delete documents from collections. These collections are defined and configured in the `/backend/models` folder, ensuring a structured and organized approach to data management.

#### Express.js

**Efficient Routing:**
Express.js provides a robust routing system, making it seamless to define endpoints for handling various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This helps in organizing the backend logic effectively, ensuring clean and maintainable code.

**Middleware Support:**

Express.js offers a wide range of middleware options that can be easily integrated into the application's request-response cycle. This enables functionalities like request parsing, authentication, logging, and error handling, enhancing the security and performance of the backend.

**Streamlined Database Interactions:**
When combined with database libraries like Mongoose (for MongoDB), Express.js simplifies the process of interacting with the database. This allows for smooth retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion of data, which is essential for building a robust API.

**Asynchronous Request Handling:**
Express.js supports asynchronous programming paradigms, allowing for non-blocking I/O operations. This is crucial for handling multiple concurrent requests efficiently, ensuring optimal performance even under heavy loads.

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a critical security feature that safeguards my application from unwanted sources attempting to access your resources. Express.js provides built-in support for CORS, making it easy to configure and enforce CORS policies. This helps in preventing malicious attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). It also helps in preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Static files server (functioning kind of like a CDN):**
Overall, Express.js provides a robust and secure foundation for building RESTful APIs.

### MongoDB and Mongoose

**MongoDB** is a popular NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for storing and retrieving data. It uses a document-based data model, which means that data is stored in JSON-like documents instead of tables and rows. This makes it easy to store and retrieve complex data structures, and allows for more flexible data modeling compared to traditional relational databases.

**Mongoose** is a popular Node.js library that provides a convenient and flexible way to interact with MongoDB. It provides a schema-based approach to defining and creating models, which makes it easier to validate and enforce data consistency. It also provides a wide range of data types and validators, making it easy to ensure that my data is stored correctly and consistently.

**Mongoose** also provides a built-in query builder that allows you to construct complex queries using a fluent API. This makes it easy to build queries that are easy to read and understand, and can be easily modified and reused.

**Mongoose** also provides a middleware system that allows you to add custom behavior to your models. This includes things like pre- and post-save hooks, virtual properties, and more. This makes it easy to add custom behavior to your models without having to modify the underlying schema.

Overall, **Mongoose** provides a convenient and flexible way to interact with **MongoDB**, and it is widely used in the Node.js community for this purpose.

**Secure User Authentication with JWT:**
In this repository, I implement secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This approach offers several advantages over traditional session-based authentication methods. Below are key reasons why JWT-based authentication is a safe and effective choice:

**Stateless Nature:**
JWTs are stateless, meaning they do not require server-side storage of session data. This eliminates the need for server-side sessions or database queries to validate user authenticity. Instead, the server can validate the token by checking its signature and expiration date, resulting in improved scalability and reduced server load.

**Data Integrity and Confidentiality:**
JWTs are digitally signed using a secret key known only to the server. This signature ensures that the token's content has not been tampered with during transmission. Additionally, sensitive information can be encrypted within the token, providing an extra layer of security.

JWTs can include custom claims, allowing for fine-grained control over user permissions. This means you can specify which resources or actions a user is allowed to access, providing a robust authorization mechanism.

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Support:**
JWTs can be easily integrated with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies. This allows for secure communication between the client and server even when they reside on different domains, without compromising security.

**Easy Integration with Frontend Frameworks:**
JWTs can be conveniently stored on the client side, typically in browser cookies or local storage. This facilitates seamless integration with frontend frameworks and libraries (like React), enabling a smooth user experience.

**Expiration and Refresh Tokens:**
JWTs can be configured with expiration times, reducing the window of opportunity for potential attackers. Additionally, you can implement refresh tokens to obtain new JWTs without requiring users to re-enter their credentials.

**Conclusion:**
By implementing user authentication with JWTs, this repository ensures a robust and secure authentication mechanism. The stateless nature, data integrity, and ease of integration make JWTs an excellent choice for validating user authenticity. With careful implementation and adherence to best practices, this approach provides a reliable foundation for secure user authentication in my application.

### ES Lint and Prettier

**ES Lint:**
I'm using **ES Lint** to get my code up-to-date with strict code standards as much as is tolerable and logical (most strict setting is not a logical configuration). The VS Code ES Lint extension has some cool features like auto-fixing a lot of errors like the rule to enforce sorting props alphabetically so props will always be in the same order as parameter of a components as the place where the components is used in the JSX.

## Project management

### Jira

Im using a **Jira** board with 4 swim lanes: TODO, IN PROGRESS, BUSY and DONE to sort my project issues.

![Jira Board](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN-Enterprise-Search/blob/main/screenshots/Jira-Board.png?raw=true)

**TODO** issues I haven't started working on yet.

**IN PROGRESS** issues are in progress.

**BUSY** issues are the issues I am working on and have higher priority to finish. A lot of the times other issues are dependent on the **BUSY** issues, that's the main reason I chose to add this swim lane.

**DONE** issues are finished.

- [x] [MERNSTACK-292] Correct the README.md file everywhere I talk about Base64 strings and Blob images. My understanding was wrong and that's why it needs to be corrected to actual information. Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme.

- [ ] [MERNSTACK-] Generate GIF files from screen records, follow these instructions:
      **START INSTRUCTIONS:**
      \*\*\*\*Creating a high-quality GIF within the constraints of a 100MB file size for GitHub involves a balance between duration, quality, and compression. Here's a guide using FFmpeg and Gifski:

### Prerequisites

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- [Gifski](https://gif.ski/)

### Steps

#### Step 1: Record Your Screen

Use a screen recording tool to capture the content you want. OBS Studio, ShareX, or QuickTime (on macOS) are good options.

#### Step 2: Edit the Recording (if needed)

Trim unnecessary portions from your recording using video editing software.

#### Step 3: Convert Video to GIF with FFmpeg

Open a command prompt or terminal and use FFmpeg to convert your video to GIF. Adjust the parameters to achieve the desired quality and file size:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "fps=15,scale=640:-1:flags=lanczos" -c:v gif output.gif
```

- `fps`: Adjust the frame rate (e.g., 15 frames per second).
- `scale`: Set the width to 640 pixels (adjust as needed).

#### Step 4: Optimize GIF with Gifski

Use Gifski to optimize and compress the GIF:

```bash
gifski -o output.gif input.mp4
```

This command will compress the GIF while maintaining high quality.

#### Step 5: Check File Size

Ensure the resulting GIF is smaller than 100MB. If it's still too large, consider adjusting parameters or shortening the duration.

#### Step 6: Repeat if Necessary

If the GIF is still too large, you may need to compromise on quality, reduce resolution, or shorten the duration further.

#### Step 7: Upload to GitHub

Once satisfied with the quality and size, upload the GIF to your GitHub repository.

Remember to test the GIF on GitHub to ensure it meets the platform's requirements. If necessary, further optimization may be needed.

# DocsGPT

Absolutely! Nextra is a great choice for building an informational website. To provide an interactive experience and keep your readers entertained, here are some suggestions:

1. **Embed Interactive Widgets**: You can embed interactive widgets such as maps, charts, sliders, or calculators to make the content more engaging. Tools like Google Maps API, Chart.js, and React Slider can be helpful for this purpose.

2. **Add Animations**: Animations can add visual interest to your website. Use libraries like React Spring or Framer Motion to easily incorporate animations into different elements such as text, images, or buttons.

3. **Include Interactive Quizzes or Surveys**: Integrate interactive quizzes or surveys within your website to make it more interactive. Tools like Typeform or Google Forms can help you create and embed interactive forms.

4. **Implement Interactive Code Examples**: If you are writing about code or programming concepts, consider using code playgrounds like CodePen or CodeSandbox to provide interactive code examples that users can modify and execute directly on your website.

5. **Integrate Social Media Feeds**: Display social media feeds related to your application or topic to provide real-time updates and encourage user engagement. You can use APIs provided by popular social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook to fetch and display the feeds.

6. **Include Interactive Infographics**: Infographics can present complex information in a visually appealing way. Use tools like Infogram or Canva to create interactive infographics and embed them into your website.

7. **Incorporate Gamification Elements**: Gamify your website by adding interactive features like badges, points, or progress bars. Users can earn rewards for completing certain actions or reaching milestones on your website.

Remember to consider your target audience and the purpose of your website while incorporating interactive elements. Too many or overly complex interactive features may distract users from the main content. Strive for a balance between interactivity and readability to enhance the overall user experience.
